An extensive English-language literature retrieval on clinical outcomes after treatment by ABVD versus BEACOPP was conducted on Medline, PubMed, and Embase through the period ending December 2015. Odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was pooled based on the heterogeneity across individual studies. In total, seven articles reporting on four trials were included in this meta-analysis. Patients assigned to BEACOPP therapy had a better complete remission (CR) rate (OR = 0.55, 95 % CI 0.35, 0.87), overall survival (OS) greater than 5 years (OR = 0.64, 95 % CI 0.51, 0.81), and progression-free survival (PFS, OR = 0.56, 95 % CI 0.38, 0.81) than patients assigned to ABVD therapy. Subgroup analysis stratified using a different strategy showed no significant difference for OS between short courses of escalated BEACOPP combined with standard BEACOPP and that for ABVD (OR = 0. 72, 95 % CI 0. 45, 1.15). Reduced progression/relapse, better CR, and similar OS were observed with BEACOPP, indicating its superior efficiency of BEACOPP in the treatment of HL.

Preliminary data show that brentuximab vedotin alone is not adequate therapy for newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma in older patients, but modestly decreases the risk of relapse when combined with adriamycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated advanced-stage disease. In second-line therapy, combining brentuximab vedotin with conventional chemotherapy or with PD-1 inhibitors as pretransplant salvage is associated with high overall and complete response rates, although further follow up is needed to assess whether posttransplant outcomes are improved. Although these new drugs are well tolerated when given as single agents, unexpected toxicities have been encountered with combination regimens, specifically severe pulmonary toxicity with the bleomycin and brentuximab vedotin combination and frequent infusion-related reactions. There is concern with the use of PD-1 inhibitors as first-line therapy due to the theoretical potential for more frequent or severe immune-mediated toxicities in patients who have not received prior chemotherapy.

Moreover, with the use of response-adapted strategies using positron-emission-tomography (PET), the overall intensity of treatment for most patients can be reduced, resulting in less acute and late toxicity. However, these advances are mainly restricted to younger patients, as advances in patients above the age of 60 years ('older' patients) have been much less pronounced. Furthermore, about one third of all HL patients are among the older population, but only 5-10% of the patients treated in current HL clinical trials are ≥60 years old. HL in older patients is characterized by aggressive disease and unfavourable prognostic features as B symptoms and predominance of advanced stages. In addition, tolerance to curative chemotherapy is drastically reduced in older patients resulting in excessive toxicity and insufficient treatment due to therapy delays and dose reductions.

The resulting programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells as well as the PD-L1 expressed in the HL microenvironment result in an ineffective host antitumor immune response and make HL a ripe target for programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) blockade.

Based on these data, nivolumab and pembrolizumab were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced rel/ref HL. Evidence has emerged that patients with HL benefit from continued PD-1 blockade beyond disease progression according to traditionally defined response criteria, and that the addition of, or switch to, chemotherapy after anti-PD-1 antibody failure can potentially re-induce clinical response. Subsequent studies have evaluated novel anti-PD-1-based combination regimens as well as the use of anti-PD-1 antibody therapy earlier in the course of a HL patient's therapy, including first salvage therapy for rel/ref disease (eg, nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin) and even first-line treatment (eg, nivolumab added to doxorubicin, vinblastine, dacarbazine chemotherapy).

Despite the presence of an immune infiltrate within the tumor microenvironment, the malignant cells effectively evade the immune system and appear to utilize the presence of immune cells to promote the growth and survival of Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg cells. Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg cells evade immune detection because of overexpression of programmed death 1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, which suppress T-cell activation, and loss of expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules that prevent effective immune recognition. Recognition of these immune defects has led to clinical use of immune checkpoint blockade in classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Clinical trials using antibodies that block programmed death 1/PD-L1 signaling have shown remarkable responses to therapy and have led to the approval of nivolumab and pembrolizumab for use in patients with relapsed and refractory disease.

However, especially in adolescents and young adults, treatment-related toxicity and long-term morbidity still represent persistent challenges. Moreover, outcomes in patients with relapsed or refractory disease remain unfavorable in the era of high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation. Hence, there is a high demand for novel and innovative alternative treatment approaches. In recent years, many new therapeutic agents have emerged from preclinical and clinical studies that target molecular hallmarks of Hodgkin lymphoma, including the aberrant phenotype of the tumor cells, deregulated oncogenic pathways, and immune escape. The antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin and immune checkpoint inhibitors have already shown great success in patients with relapsed/refractory disease, leading to US Food and Drug Administration approval and new trials testing these agents in various clinical settings. The expanding knowledge and understanding of Hodgkin lymphoma biology and disease progression, as well as the development of robust tools for biomarker-driven risk stratification and therapeutic decision making, continue to be fundamentally important for the success of these and other novel agents.

The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the company's submission to NICE. According to the NICE scope, pembrolizumab was compared with single or combination chemotherapy. Comparisons were undertaken in two populations: patients who did and did not receive prior autologous stem cell transplant (autoSCT; populations 1 and 2, respectively). Despite it having been recommended by NICE in population 1 at the time the ERG received the company submission, nivolumab was not included as a comparator. No studies directly comparing pembrolizumab and its comparators were identified. One ongoing, single-arm study of the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-087) and one comparative observational study (Cheah et al., 2016) were used to inform the comparative effectiveness of pembrolizumab and standard of care (SoC), using indirect comparisons in both populations. Almost all analyses showed significant PFS and overall response rate benefits for pembrolizumab versus SoC, but due to being based on indirect comparison, were likely to contain systematic error. The economic evaluation therefore suffered from substantial uncertainty in any estimates of cost effectiveness. Furthermore, there was a lack of evidence on the uptake and timing of allogeneic stem cell transplant, and alternative assumptions had a significant impact on cost effectiveness. Immature survival data from KEYNOTE-087 exacerbated this issue and necessitated the use of alternative data sources for longer-term extrapolation of survival. Some issues identified in the company's analyses were amended by the ERG. The revised ERG deterministic base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on the company's second Appraisal Consultation Document response for pembrolizumab versus SoC (with a commercial access agreement) for populations 1 and 2 were £54,325 and £62,527 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. There was substantial uncertainty around these ICERs, especially in population 2. NICE did not recommend pembrolizumab as an option for treating RRcHL in population 1, but recommended pembrolizumab for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund in population 2.",30895564,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30895564/
