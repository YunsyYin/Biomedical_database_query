0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2018,"BCG Vaccine, Deoxycytidine, Epirubicin, Mitomycin, gemcitabine, Isoniazid","Various intravesical therapies have been introduced into clinical practices for controlling non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, evidence with respect to the efficacy and safety of those intravesical therapies is very limited. Hence, we present a network meta-analysis in order to address this limitation in the current literature. The primary outcomes were the risk of tumor recurrence (TR), tumor progression (TP) and disease-specific mortality (DM). Secondary outcomes included the risk of fever, cystitis and haematuria. Conventional pair-wise and network meta-analysis were both performed for each endpoint. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was incorporated in our analysis for ranking the corresponding intravesical instillation interventions. In total, 23 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were finally included in our study after irrelevant papers were screened out. Results of network meta-analysis suggested that Epirubicin (EPI) was less preferable than Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG), BCG+EPI, BCG+ Isoniazid (INH), BCG+ Mytomicin C (MMC), Gemcitabine (GEM) and MMC with respect to TR. As suggested by the corresponding ranking probabilities and SUCRA, incorporating EPI or MMC into BCG may enhance the efficacy of BCG monotherapy.",27788495,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27788495/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2021,"B7-H1 Antigen, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor","We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the response rates of patients with treatment-refractory urothelial carcinoma treated with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors. We reviewed the literature for prospective studies evaluating PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in refractory urothelial carcinoma patients, which formed the basis for US Food and Drug Administration approval of 5 different antagonistic antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab). We considered studies examining PD-1/PD-L1-treated patients, which we identified using the following key terms in the Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrial.gov, and Cochrane Library databases. Eligible studies had ≥ 20 patients each and reported response rates, duration of response, and overall survival (OS). We performed fixed and random-effects meta-analyses to model the point estimates for objective response rate and complete response. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS for studies reporting these statistics were evaluated. We found 10 eligible studies that met our inclusion criteria, providing extractable numerators and denominators for response rates, PFS, and OS for 1934 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The objective response rate was 18% (95% confidence interval, 15-22) for second-line or later therapies. The random-effects estimate for complete response was 4% (95% confidence interval, 3-5), including all disease locations and all PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. Median OS and PFS were < 13 months and 3 months, respectively, across all studies, irrespective of PD-L1 expression. We found that the estimated response rates of agents included in this meta-analysis seem to be more favorable than other salvage therapies.",32146152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32146152/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,"<b>Aims:</b> Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have recently revolutionized the treatment landscape of metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The authors performed a meta-analysis aiming to evaluate the predictive value of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, age, sex, liver metastasis and histology in trials comparing first-line ICI-based combinations with chemotherapy in metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients. <b>Methods:</b> Hazard ratios were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> ICI-based combinations significantly decreased the risk of death in several clinicopathological subgroups, including patients with no liver metastases (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74-0.95) and those with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.72-0.97). <b>Conclusion:</b> The benefit of ICI-based combinations over chemotherapy in metastatic urothelial carcinoma was consistent across several clinicopathological subgroups, although a proportion of patients responded to chemotherapy alone.",35048736,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35048736/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,"Biomarkers, Tumor, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors","Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a widespread malignancy with a worse prognosis often related to a late diagnosis. For early-stage MIBC pts, a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to evaluate the timing of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and surgery. The current standard therapy is platinum-based NAC (MVAC-methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin or Platinum-Gemcitabine regimens) followed by radical cystectomy (RC) with lymphadenectomy. However, preliminary data from Vesper trial highlighted that dose-dense NAC MVAC is endowed with a good pathological response but shows low tolerability. In the last few years, translational-based research approaches have identified several candidate biomarkers of NAC esponsiveness, such as ERCC2, ERBB2, or DNA damage response (DDR) gene alterations. Moreover, the recent consensus MIBC molecular classification identified six molecular subtypes, characterized by different sensitivity to chemo- or targeted or immunotherapy, that could open a novel procedure for patient selection and also for neoadjuvant therapies. The Italian PURE-01 phase II Trial extended data on efficacy and resistance to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) in this setting. In this review, we summarize the most relevant literature data supporting NAC use in MIBC, focusing on novel therapeutic strategies such as immunotherapy, considering the better patient stratification and selection emerging from novel molecular classification.",35163064,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35163064/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,"Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a rare and challenging-to-treat malignancy. In most patients it is a sporadic tumor entity, less commonly it falls on the spectrum of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant familial tumor syndrome. Localized UTUC with high-risk features as well as the metastatic disease scenario might require systemic therapy. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy is currently the recommended management option. However, the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors into the therapeutic armamentarium has led to a paradigm shift in treatment standards. Immunotherapy has been shown to be safe and effective in treating at least metastatic UTUC, although UTUC-specific high-level evidence is still lacking. Recent technological advances and noteworthy research efforts have greatly improved the general understanding of the biological landscape of UTUC. According to the main findings, UTUC represent a particular subtype of urothelial carcinoma frequently associated with activated FGFR3 signaling, a luminal-papillary phenotype and a T-cell-depleted microenvironment. This improved knowledge promises precision oncology approaches that match treatment decision strategies and genomic profile to ultimately result in better clinical outcomes. The aim of this review was to summarize the main currently available evidence on immune checkpoint inhibition and clinical genomics in UTUC.",35200559,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35200559/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,"Therapies based on the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab, have proven effective in the treatment of metastatic urological neoplasms. Recently, it has been hypothesized that the use of this type of treatment prior to surgery could lead to an increased difficulty in renal and bladder surgeries. The literature concerning this topic, however, is still scarce and non-consensual. In our systematic review, we used the PRISMA guidelines methodology to search the pertinent literature available up to June 18, 2020 in PubMed. Additionally, we searched the related grey literature in the abstracts of the meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary (ASCO-GU), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and American Urological Association (AUA) from 2015 to 2020. We were able to find only 16 publications that addressed the use of ICIs prior to surgery in kidney and bladder neoplasms. The results were conflicting, and usually the issue of surgical difficulties after the use of ICIs was not directly approached. We hope that our publication may raise the awareness towards the need to further investigate the effects of neoadjuvant ICIs on surgical outcomes in urologic cancers.",34312011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34312011/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,"Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, avelumab","Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in metastatic UC holds much promise, but has not been optimized.

0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,BCG Vaccine,"In the past decades, the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, especially for intermediate and high-risk groups, is increasingly accepted by multiple guidelines. Currently, the front-line setting for the high-risk group is still intravesical BCG instillation. However, the BCG mechanism, usage, adverse events, and the definition of BCG failure are not yet fully understood or defined. In addition, despite BCG being generally efficacious, a number of bladder cancer patients are unresponsive to the BCG immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the history and current status of BCG immunotherapy, and highlight recent developments in designing novel strategies for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive patients.",36274226,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36274226/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,"Due to the approval of immuno-oncological therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors, the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma has become more complex in all lines of therapy. Thus, in first-line treatment, immunotherapy alone or immune maintenance therapy following platinum-based chemotherapy can be applied in addition to treatment with platinum-based combination therapies alone. In addition to the approval status and guideline recommendation, patient-specific factors such as comorbidities as well as patient preference must always be considered when choosing a therapy. In the following, we summarize the current data on treatment options in the first-line therapy of metastatic urothelial carcinoma and illustrate their practical application using a patient example.",35089362,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35089362/

0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,"Patients with urothelial carcinoma tend to be older and frailer with a large number of chronic medical conditions. This is particularly pronounced in those with unresectable locally advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Prior to 2016, treatment options in advanced urothelial carcinoma were limited to chemotherapy, and as a result, a large number of patients were not receiving disease-directed management. Over the last 6 years, multiple alternative modalities including immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies have been introduced. They are being utilized clinically in older and frail patients, but there are limited studies investigating outcomes in these specific populations. Based upon current evidence, age does not impact the efficacy and tolerance of immune checkpoint inhibitors if patients are fit enough to receive therapy. In frailer patients, immune checkpoint inhibitors appear to be safe, but outcomes from largely retrospective studies demonstrate mixed data regarding their efficacy. Although there are indications from clinical trials that enfortumab vedotin, sacituzumab govitecan, and erdafitinib are also efficacious irrespective of age, there is still not enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions about their use in older and frail patients. Regardless, in all older patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, it is critical to evaluate for frailty through geriatric screening tools and comprehensive assessments. Combining these evaluations with consideration of an individual patient's goals should be the foundation upon which therapeutic decisions are made in this population of patients.",35344197,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35344197/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,"Adjuvants, Immunologic, BCG Vaccine, Mitomycin","Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) represents a significant global therapeutic challenge, particularly in the era of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) shortage. High-risk NMIBC can progress to muscle invasive or metastatic disease in 25% of patients. Optimal treatment selection, according to risk stratification, is imperative. International guidelines slightly differ in their categorisation of low, intermediate and high-risk NMIBC. Nonetheless, a single post-operative instillation of chemotherapy with Mitomycin C (MMC) or Gemcitabine improves relapse-free survival (RFS) in low-risk NMIBC. Induction and maintenance intravesical BCG remains the historical gold standard for patients with intermediate or high-risk NMIBC. However, clinicians may be forced to consider alternatives given the current BCG shortage. Both intravesical MMC and Gemcitabine have been associated with similar efficacy to BCG, albeit in smaller studies. MMC may also be manipulated using a variety of methods to potentiate its effects. BCG treatment delivery may also be modified without affecting efficacy through dose reduction and abbreviation or omission of maintenance therapy. Preliminary data also highlight that directly proceeding to radical cystectomy may not adversely affect long-term quality of life measures. Access to new systemic and intravesical therapies must be prioritised for patients with BCG recurrent or unresponsive disease. When used in conjunction with molecularly defined biomarkers, these agents herald the potential for improved survival outcomes and alleviation of the current BCG shortage.",35083522,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35083522/

0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,"Anilides, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Pyridines, cabozantinib","Treatment options for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) have increased dramatically over the past decade. However, even when novel approaches have proven to be effective as monotherapy, many patients still develop progressive disease, and different strategies are needed to increase clinical response and quality of life. Strategies combining targeted therapy (TT) and immunotherapy (IO) have emerged as a way to shorten the gap between responders and nonresponders to monotherapy and have reported promising results. In this review, we discuss the current role of cabozantinib in combination with IO agents in the treatment of metastatic RCC and UC and go over future directions in the field.",34766841,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34766841/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,"Adjuvants, Immunologic, BCG Vaccine","Bladder cancer is the 10th most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide with 5-year survival rate around 70%. The current first-line treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is transurethral resection of bladder tumours followed by intravesical Mycobacterium Bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy. However, tumor recurrence rate is still high ranging from 31% to 78% within five years. To avoid radical cystectomy, intravesical combination therapies have been developed as salvage treatments to overcome BCG failure. Recent advances in diagnostics thanks to tumor molecular profiling and in treatment such as development of immunotherapies provides more treatment options beyond BCG treatment. This also goes hand-in hand with formulation advances to deliver these new therapies where traditional drug delivery systems might not be suitable, which in turn is completed by challenges to deliver drugs via the intravesical route. In this article the aim was to provide an in-depth analysis of the current developments of intravesical combination therapies, ranging from relatively simple combinations of mixing existed intravesical therapeutic agents (immunotherapies and chemotherapies) to the combined formulations containing advanced gene therapies and targeted therapies, with special focus on therapies that have made it to the clinical trial stage. In addition, recent attempts to utilize device-assisted treatments and novel drug delivery platforms are included. This review also highlights the limitations that still need to be overcome such as the inadequate studies on newly explored drug carriers and proposes potential directions for future work to overcome BCG-failure.",35580708,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35580708/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,"Adjuvants, Immunologic, BCG Vaccine, Biomarkers, Immunologic Factors","Within the heterogeneous population of patients with bacillus Calmette-Guérin failure, there are clear differences in prognosis and therapy with regard to the timeline when bacillus Calmette-Guérin failure occurred. There are a variety of classifications which include bacillus Calmette-Guérin refractory disease, relapsing, unresponsive, and intolerant. Further profiling of these patients may help to shed light on other forms of therapy that are less radical. We hereby summarize the different biomarkers that predicts for response to bacillus Calmette-Guérin immunotherapy and bacillus Calmette-Guérin failure for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.",35598896,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35598896/

Conversely, they can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and some of them are severe or fatal. Furthermore, evidence on the safety and effectiveness of the readministration of ICIs after the occurrence of irAEs is limited. In this case report, a 78-year-old man who suffered from metastatic right renal pelvic cancer was treated with pembrolizumab. He had a partial response to pembrolizumab, but he developed grade 3 myasthenia gravis. The myasthenia gravis symptoms were immediately relieved by corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. When the disease rapidly progressed, he was treated again with pembrolizumab. After 5 days, a chest radiograph showed shrinkage of pulmonary metastases. Unfortunately, he died of multiple brain infarctions 7 days after the readministration.

0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,"Antibodies, Bispecific, Cytokines, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Immunoconjugates","Bladder carcinoma is the most common genitourinary cancer, with a high prevalence and global incidence. In addition to early detection by cytology, the management of bladder cancer has recently advanced, not only by improvements in conventional treatments such as surgery and chemotherapy, but also through the introduction of immunotherapeutic strategies. The number of approved immunotherapeutic agents has dramatically increased, with various preclinical and clinical applications in cancer drug discovery. Some bladder cancer immunotherapies include immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapy, cytokine-based therapy, bispecific antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates. This review provides an overview of some of the innovative immunotherapeutic agents approved and in development that can potentially be used in the treatment of bladder cancer.",35653623,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35653623/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,"Antineoplastic Agents, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Immunoconjugates","In recent years, considerable progress has been made in increasing the knowledge of tumour biology and drug resistance mechanisms in urothelial cancer. Therapeutic strategies have significantly advanced with the introduction of novel approaches such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor inhibitors. However, despite these novel agents, advanced urothelial cancer is often still progressive in spite of treatment and correlates with a poor prognosis. The introduction of antibody-drug conjugates consisting of a target-specific monoclonal antibody covalently linked to a payload (cytotoxic agent) is a novel and promising therapeutic strategy. In December 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to the nectin-4-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, enfortumab vedotin, for the treatment of advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinomas that are refractory to both immune checkpoint inhibitors and platinum-based treatment. Heavily pre-treated urothelial cancer patients reported a significant, 40% response to enfortumab vedotin while other antibody-drug conjugates are currently still under investigation in several clinical trials. We have comprehensively reviewed the available treatment strategies for advanced urothelial carcinoma and outlined the mechanism of action of antibody-drug conjugate agents, their clinical applications, resistance mechanisms and future strategies for urothelial cancer.",35953604,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35953604/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,"BCG Vaccine, Cytokines, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Interleukins","The high recurrence rate of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (BC) and poor prognosis of advanced BC are therapeutic challenges that need to be solved. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) perfusion was the pioneer immunotherapy for early BC, and the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors has created a new chapter in the treatment of advanced BC. The benefit of immunotherapy is highly anticipated, but its effectiveness still needs to be improved. In this review, we collated and analysed the currently available information and explored the mechaisms by which the internal immune imbalance of BC leads to tumour progression. The relationship between immunity and progression and the prognosis of BC has been explored through tests using body fluids such as blood and urine. These analytical tests have attempted to identify specific immuyne cells and cytokines to predict treatment outcomes and recurrence. The diversity and proportion of immune and matrix cells in BC determine the heterogeneity and immune status of tumours. The role and classification of immune cells have also been redefined, e.g., CD4 cells having recognised cytotoxicity in BC. Type 2 immunity, including that mediated by M2 macrophages, Th2 cells, and interleukin (IL)-13, plays an important role in the recurrence and progression of BC. Pathological fibrosis, activated by type 2 immunity and cancer cells, enhances the rate of cancer progression and irreversibility. Elucidating the immune status of BC and clarifying the mechanisms of action of different cells in the tumour microenvironment is the research direction to be explored in the future.",36159866,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36159866/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,"Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, avelumab, Cisplatin","Until recently, international and Asia-specific guidelines for advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) recommended first-line (1L) platinum-based chemotherapy, followed by second-line (2L) anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy where possible, or 1L ICI therapy in cisplatin-ineligible patients with PD-L1+ tumors. However, long-term outcomes remain poor and only a minority of patients receive 2L therapy. The JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial-which assessed avelumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) as 1L maintenance therapy plus best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone in patients with advanced UC that had not progressed with 1L platinum-based chemotherapy-is the only phase 3 trial of ICI-based treatment in the 1L setting to show significantly improved overall survival, and this treatment approach is now recommended in updated treatment guidelines. Available data from the trial suggest that efficacy and safety in patients enrolled in the Asia-Pacific region were similar to findings in the overall population. In this review, we discuss the treatment of advanced UC, with a specific focus on studies in the Asia-Pacific region, and summarize key findings supporting the use of avelumab 1L maintenance as a standard of care in this setting both in cisplatin-eligible and cisplatin-ineligible patients and irrespective of PD-L1 status.",35238147,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35238147/

0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,"B7-H1 Antigen, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors","Despite the recent approval of numerous immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for the treatment of genitourinary tumors, predictive biomarkers are still lacking. Different approaches are necessary, as the only approved biomarker for urothelial carcinoma (UC), namely PD-L1 immunostaining, has questionable predictive value. By contrast, tumor-infiltrating cells have been associated with therapy response in both UC and renal cell carcinoma. Tumor-derived gene signatures can further identify patients with pre-existing adaptive immunity. Whereas tumor mutation burden, DNA repair defects, and microsatellite instability are of some predictive value, the utility of single gene mutations has not yet been proved. As ICIs mainly target tumor metastases, analysis of primary tumors appears to be suboptimal. Circulating biomarkers reflecting tumor and systemic alterations in a more complex and dynamic manner are of great potential. The most promising approach is an analysis of complex tumor composition with concomitant consideration of the host immune status, which is also influenced by the gut microbiome. PATIENT SUMMARY: Immunotherapy is one of the treatment options for cancers of the urinary tract and kidney. We review the methods for measuring biomarkers that may predict which patients are most likely to respond to this treatment.",35918269,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35918269/
0,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,2022,"BCG Vaccine, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors","Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is characterized by a high rate of cure, but also by a non-negligible probability of recurrence and risk progression to muscle-invasive disease. NMIBC management requires a proper local resection and staging, followed by a risk-based treatment with intravesical agents. For many years, the current gold standard treatment for patients with intermediate or high-risk disease is transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) followed by intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillations. Unfortunately, in about half of high-risk patients, intravesical BCG treatment fails and NMIBC persists or recurs early. While radical cystectomy remains the gold standard for these patients, new therapeutic targets are being individuated and studied. Radical cystectomy in fact can provide an excellent long-term disease control, but can deeply interfere with quality of life. In particular, the enhanced immune checkpoints expression shown in BCG-unresponsive patients and the activity of immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs) in advanced bladder cancer provided the rationale for testing ICIs in NMIBC. Recently, pembrolizumab has shown promising activity in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC patients, obtaining FDA approval. Meanwhile multiple novel drugs with alternative mechanisms of action have proven to be safe and effective in NMIBC treatment and others are under investigation. The aim of this review is to analyse and describe the clinical activity of new emerging drugs in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC focusing on immunotherapy results.",35159167,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35159167/
