0,Hemangioblastoma,2013,Antineoplastic Agents,"Hemangioblastomas (HBs) are rare indolent vascular tumors that may occur sporadically or in association with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Total neurosurgical resection is the standard upfront approach providing long-term tumor control. At time of tumor recurrence, second surgery, radiosurgery or radiotherapy are the main therapeutic strategies. Limited information is available on the role of pharmacological strategies. Anti-angiogenic agents, particularly multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitors (semaxanib, sunitinib, vatalanib), thalidomide and interferon alfa-2a are currently the most widely studied strategies to prolonge disease stability. Salvage therapy with anti-angiogenetic drugs may be of benefit in some patients who are not suitable for surgery, radiosurgery or radiotherapy, with progressive or recurrent hemangioblastoma especially those located in retina, since anti-angiogenetic therapy may delay tumor progression. This strategy warrants prospective evaluation in a clinical trial.",23148943,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23148943/
0,Hemangioblastoma,2016,"Angiogenesis Inhibitors, Indazoles, Pyrimidines, Sulfonamides, pazopanib","Hemangioblastoma is a rare benign neoplasm, accounting for less than 2% of all primitive brain tumors. It may arise sporadically in a solitary form, or associated with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease with multiple tumors. Surgery is the mainstay treatment, but management is challenging in case of recurrent and/or multiple tumors. VHL protein is defective in both forms of hemangioblastoma, leading to the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor, stimulating angiogenesis via VEGF and PDGF mainly. Here, we report a 37-year-old woman's case with recurrent and rapidly progressive VHL-associated hemangioblastomas, causing severe disability. She was treated 24 months with pazopanib, a multityrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting VEGF and PDGF-Î² pathways. Despite moderate radiological changes, progressive improvement in her clinical condition persisting over 3 years was observed. Inhibiting angiogenesis is a therapeutic option that may improve the quality of life and the autonomy of VHL patients disabled with multiple hemangioblastomas.
