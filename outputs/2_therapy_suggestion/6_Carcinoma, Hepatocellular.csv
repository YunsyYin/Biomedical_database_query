A meta-analysis exploring the impact of development of sorafenib-related side effects on survival was conducted. Areas covered: Eligible studies included all clinical studies reporting on the survival/toxicity relationship in sorafenib-treated HCC patients. Data sources included Pub-Med, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and Google scholar. After exclusion of ineligible studies, 16 studies were included in the analysis. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) for patients developing diarrhoea vs. patients who did not was 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30-0.60; p < 0.00001); pooled HR for patients developing hypertension vs. those who did not was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.30-0.70; p = 0.0003); pooled HR for patients developing hand foot skin reaction vs. those who did not was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.35-0.62; p < 0.00001); pooled HR for OS for all types of skin toxicities was 0.51 (95% CI: 0.36-0.72; p = 0.0002); while pooled HR for OS for a combination of selected side effects (hypertension, HFS and diarrhoea) was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.30-0.48; p < 0.00001). No information was available regarding the impact of thyroid dysfunction or proteinuria. Expert commentary: This analysis of data demonstrated that the occurrence of sorafenib-related side effects (such as diarrhoea, hypertension and skin toxicities) is associated with a better OS in sorafenib-treated HCC patients.",27882800,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27882800/

To determine whether nucleot(s)ide analogs therapy has survival benefit for patients with HBV-related HCC after unresectable treatment. <i>Method</i>. A systematic search was conducted through seven electronic databases including PubMed, OVID, EMBASE, Cochrane Databases, Elsevier, Wiley Online Library, and BMJ Best Practice. All studies comparing NA combined with unresectable treatment versus unresectable treatment alone were considered for inclusion. The primary outcome was the overall survival (OS) after unresectable treatment for patients with HBV-related HCC. The secondary outcome was the progression-free survival (PFS). Results were expressed as hazard ratio (HR) for survival with 95% confidence intervals. <i>Results</i>. We included six studies with 994 patients: 409 patients in nucleot(s)ide analogs therapy group and 585 patients without antiviral therapy in control group. There were significant improvements for the overall survival (HR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.47-0.70; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and progression-free survival (HR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.71-0.99; <i>p</i> = 0.034) in the NA-treated group compared with the control group. Funnel plot showed that there was no significant publication bias in these studies. When it comes to antiviral drugs and operation method, it also showed benefit in NA-treated group. At the same time, overall mortality as well as mortality secondary to liver failure in NA-treated group was obviously lesser. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. <i>Conclusions</i>. Nucleot(s)ide analogs therapy after unresectable treatment has potential beneficial effects in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival. NA therapy should be considered in clinical practice.",28396612,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28396612/

Combination therapy with ICIs may provide greater anti-tumor activity compared to ICI monotherapy. This review will discuss the current treatment landscape of advanced HCC, with a focus on recently completed and ongoing trials of ICI combinations, as well as future directions.  RECENT FINDINGS: Atezolizumab/bevacizumab has been approved as first-line therapy in patients with advanced HCC based on its superiority over sorafenib in the pivotal IMbrave150 trial. Similarly, durvalumab/tremelimumab demonstrated an improvement in overall survival compared to sorafenib in the HIMALAYA trial. Other combinations of ICIs with targeted agents and dual immune checkpoint blockade are currently being investigated in large randomized Phase 3 trials for the first-line treatment of HCC. Results of several ICI combination trials have been reported or are anticipated in the next few years and may potentially expand the therapy options in this patient population.

0,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",2022,Antiviral Agents,"HCV hijacks many host metabolic processes in an effort to aid viral replication. The resulting hepatic metabolic dysfunction underpins many of the hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, the natural history of CHC is also substantially influenced by the host metabolic status: obesity, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis are major determinants of CHC progression toward hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have transformed the treatment and natural history of CHC. While DAA therapy effectively eradicates the virus, the long-lasting overlapping metabolic disease can persist, especially in the presence of obesity, increasing the risk of liver disease progression. This review covers the mechanisms by which HCV tunes hepatic and systemic metabolism, highlighting how systemic metabolic disturbance, lipotoxicity and chronic inflammation favour disease progression and a precancerous niche. We also highlight the therapeutic implications of sustained metabolic dysfunction following sustained virologic response as well as considerations for patients who develop HCC on the background of metabolic dysfunction.",35157957,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35157957/

0,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",2022,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,"Systemic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been advancing rapidly over the last decade. More novel agents, including both targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors, are available for physicians to use sequentially or concurrently for patients with advanced HCC. Despite more options, only a proportion of patients benefit from each regimen. Therefore, clinicians are facing challenges on how to choose the right regimen for the right patient with HCC, which raises the importance of personalized treatment approach. To advance personalized treatment for HCC, one approach relies on the acquisition of biomarker data from clinical trials to evaluate clinical parameters or genotypes in association with outcomes of selected drugs. This approach has led to finding of high baseline alpha-fetoprotein levels in association with benefits of ramucirumab. Cumulative findings from multiple clinical trials and translational studies also suggest that selected etiology and/or genotype of HCC could predict resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The second approach is to decipher the tumor heterogeneity of HCC with an aim to identify clinically relevant patterns to guide clinical decisions. Tumor heterogeneity could exist within a single tumor (intra-tumoral heterogeneity), among different tumors in the same patient (inter-tumoral heterogeneity) or between primary and recurrent tumors (temporal tumor heterogeneity). The analyses of tumor heterogeneity have also been powered by coverage of tumor immune environment and incorporation of circulating tumor nucleic acid technology.

Intensive care for comorbidity has gain utmost importance in care of aging chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with life-long antiviral treatment. Linkage to care of patients with CHB is essential for the goal of hepatitis B virus (HBV) eradication. As long-term suppression of HBV DNA replication does not prevent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), prevention of HCC is another challenge for NAs treatment. There is a possibility of hepatocarcinogenesis in the immune-tolerant phase and risk of loss of patients during active monitoring seeking the time point for antiviral treatment initiation. Initiation of NAs treatment from the immune-tolerant phase would improve the linkage to care. However, universal recommendation is premature and evidence for cost-effectiveness needs to be accumulated.

0,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",2022,"Antiviral Agents, Hepatitis B e Antigens","Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, due to the adverse sequelae of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, antiviral therapy has been reserved for patients with ostensibly active liver disease, fibrosis or cirrhosis, and/or increased risk of HCC. Historically, patients with hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic infection, were not offered antiviral therapy. Nevertheless, there has been compelling evidence emerging in recent years, demonstrating that this disease phase is in fact not characterized by immunological tolerance. HBV integration into the human genome is a frequent event found in these patients. Additionally, it may well be associated with active inflammation and fibrosis, even in the presence of persistently normal liver enzymes. Likewise, it appears that the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis are already present during this early stage of the disease. This was reflected in the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines, where treating patients above the age of 30 years with HBeAg-positive chronic infection was proposed. Lowering the treatment threshold to broaden treatment eligibility is likely to slow disease progression and reduce the risk of developing HCC.

HBV infects around 257 million individuals worldwide. Hepatitis B in many individuals ultimately develops hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The innate immunity acts as the first line of defense against HBV infection through activating antiviral genes. Along with the immune responses, pro-inflammatory cytokines are triggered to enhance the antiviral responses, but this may result in acute or chronic liver inflammation, especially when the clearance of virus is unsuccessful. To a degree, the host innate immune and inflammatory responses dominate the HBV infection and liver pathogenesis. Thus, it is crucial to figure out the signaling pathways involved in the activation of antiviral factors and inflammatory cytokines. Here, we review the interplay between HBV and the signal pathways that mediates innate immune responses and inflammation.

Conclusion: Our results indicate that atezolizumab+bevacizumab is the best first-line clinically relevant systemic modality in advanced HCC. TACE+sorafenib may also be considered for the disease with portal invasion. (PROSPERO No. CRD42021250701).",35785525,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35785525/
0,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",2022,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,"The advent of immunotherapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has changed the treatment landscape and conferred a survival benefit on patients with advanced HCC, who typically have a very poor prognosis. The most pronounced improvements in response, as documented by standardized response criteria based on CT or MRI, have been achieved when immunotherapy is combined with other systemic or locoregional therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments result in unique patterns on CT and MRI that challenge the application of conventional response criteria such as RECIST, modified RECIST, and European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria. Thus, newer criteria have been developed to gauge therapy response or disease progression for patients receiving immunotherapy, including immune-related RECIST (iRECIST) and immune-modified RECIST (imRECIST), though these remain unvalidated. In this review, we describe the current landscape of immunotherapeutic agents used for HCC, summarize the results of published studies, review the pathobiologic mechanisms that provide a rationale for the use of these agents, and report on the status of response assessment for immunotherapy either alone or in combination with other treatment options. Finally, consensus statements are provided to inform radiologists about essential considerations in the era of a rapidly changing treatment paradigm for patients with HCC.",35506555,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35506555/

To summarize the evidence supporting the systemic treatment of Chinese patients with advanced HCC, we performed a systematic review using a literature search of PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Chinese Scientific Journal Database between 1 January 2009 and 15 June 2021, and abstracts from ASCO 2020, ASCO GI 2021, ESMO 2020, and ESMO GI 2020. The inclusion criteria were: Chinese patients aged ≥18 years with advanced HCC; first- or second-line systemic therapy; an evaluation of the efficacy or safety outcomes; and a randomized controlled, non-randomized controlled, prospective, or retrospective design. Thirty reports were identified for the following therapies: the single-agent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; <i>n</i> = 10), single-agent programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor (<i>n</i> = 4), chemotherapy (<i>n</i> = 5), PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor plus TKI (<i>n</i> = 6), PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor plus bevacizumab or biosimilar (<i>n</i> = 4), and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy (<i>n</i> = 1). The heterogeneity between the studies precluded statistical analysis and the data were summarized using tables. In the first-line setting, evidence supported the use of atezolizumab or sintilimab plus bevacizumab or a biosimilar. There remains insufficient evidence to determine the optimal approved TKI-based therapeutic option, and active controlled trials in the second-line setting were lacking.",36290852,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36290852/
0,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",2022,"Calcineurin Inhibitors, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Sorafenib, TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases","Despite stringent selection criteria, hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) still occurs in up to 20% of cases, mostly within the first 2-3 years. No adjuvant treatments to prevent such an occurrence have been developed so far. However, a balanced use of immunosuppression with minimal dose of calcineurin inhibitors and possible addition of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors is strongly advisable. Moreover, several pre- and post-transplant predictors of recurrence have been identified and may help determine the frequency and duration of post-transplant follow-up. When recurrence occurs, the outcomes are poor with a median survival of 12 mo according to most retrospective studies. The factor that most impacts survival after recurrence is timing (within 1-2 years from LT according to different authors). Several therapeutic options may be chosen in case of recurrence, according to timing and disease presentation. Surgical treatment seems to provide a survival benefit, especially in case of late recurrence, while the benefit of locoregional treatments has been suggested only in small retrospective studies. When systemic treatment is indicated, sorafenib has been proved safe and effective, while only few data are available for lenvatinib and regorafenib in second line. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is controversial in this setting, given the safety warnings for the risk of acute rejection.",36160651,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36160651/
0,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",2022,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death. Surgery, local ablative therapies and liver transplantation are the only potentially curative strategies, but the majority of patients present with advanced disease at diagnosis or develop recurrence after surgery. In recent years, immunotherapy for HCC has received growing interest, and one of the most promising strategies is the association of two immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which has already demonstrated its potential in other solid tumors such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Herein, we discuss the role and the biologic rationale of dual immune checkpoint blockade in HCC patients, focusing on the two ICI combinations: nivolumab plus ipilimumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab.",35109664,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35109664/
0,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",2022,"Protein Kinase Inhibitors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A, Sorafenib","The treatment landscape for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma has changed dramatically over the past 4 years. We now have numerous options for patients in frontline, second-line, and beyond. The most significant impact has been the introduction of immunotherapy into our treatment paradigms. We now have regimens that induce consistent double-digit objective response rates and markedly improve overall survival (OS) with favorable side effect profiles. The combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab has demonstrated that the combination of targeting programmed death-ligand 1 and the vascular endothelial growth factor axis can improve outcomes versus sorafenib in the IMBrave150 study. Results from the COSMIC-312 study evaluating the multikinase vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, and <i>AXL</i> tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab improved progression-free survival versus sorafenib, but at this time, there is no improvement in OS and response rates were lower than expected. Additional data with similar combinations are awaited on the basis of encouraging early-phase data. In addition, the combination of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 and programmed cell death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 targeting is yielding similar promising early results, and the phase III HIMALAYA study met its primary end points of improving OS versus sorafenib for durvalumab plus tremelimumab and demonstrated noninferiority for single-agent durvalumab as well. However, this combination did not improve progression-free survival and objective response rates with this combination did not seem significantly different from that with single-agent durvalumab. Although there are still knowledge gaps in this rapidly changing landscape, we will address some of the important questions relevant to making therapeutic decisions in the management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in the modern era on the basis of our current knowledge of the safety and efficacy of these evolving regimens. The goal is to provide clinicians with the knowledge needed to optimize outcomes for their patients.",35649192,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35649192/
0,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",2022,"B7-H1 Antigen, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, Sorafenib","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has high mortality. The option of systemic therapy has increased significantly over the past five years. Sorafenib was the first multikinase inhibitor, introduced in 2007, as a treatment option for HCC, and it was the only effective systemic treatment for more than ten years. It was not until 2017 that several breakthroughs were made in the development of systemic strategies. Lenvatinib, another multikinase inhibitor, stood out successfully after sorafenib, and has been applied to clinical use in the first-line setting. Other multikinase inhibitors such as regorafenib, ramucirumab and cabozantinib, were approved in quick succession as second-line therapies. Concurrently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have readily become established treatments for many solid tumors, including HCC. The most studied ICIs to date, target programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), its ligand PD-L1, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). These ICIs have demonstrated efficacy in treating advanced HCC. More recently, combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab (ICI targeting PD-L1) was approved as the gold-standard first-line therapy. Combination of ICIs with nivolumab and ipilimumab was also approved in the second-line setting for those who failed sorafenib. At the moment, numerous clinical trials in advanced HCC are underway, which will bring continuous change to the management, and increase the survival, for patients with advanced HCC. Our review article: (1) summarizes United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) approved systemic therapies in advanced HCC, (2) reports the evidence of currently approved treatments, (3) discusses potential drugs/drug combinations being currently tested in phase III clinical trials, and (4) proposes possible future directions in drug development for advanced HCC.",36005172,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36005172/
