A fully recursive literature search of the primary electronic databases for available trials was performed. The objective response rate (ORR) and the median progression-free survival (PFS) of clinical responses were considered the main endpoints to evaluate the efficacy, whereas Grade 3-4 adverse effects (AEs) were analyzed to evaluate safety. The ORR of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors was 30% (95% CI: 25-35%). No significant difference in the ORR was observed after the comparisons of low-dose, median-dose, and high-dose cohorts. In addition, the rate of Grade 3-4 AEs was 9% (95% CI: 6-12%). According to the 3 randomized controlled trials that compared PD-1 inhibitors with chemotherapy, the difference between these 2 groups was found to be statistically significant with respect to the ORR, PFS and the incidence of Grade 3-4 AEs; that is, the relative risk (RR) of the ORR was 3.42 (95% CI: 2.49-4.69, P < 0.001), the hazard ratio (HR) of the PFS was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.44-0.58, P < 0.001), and the RR of Grade 3-4 AEs was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.31-0.65, P < 0.001). According to a meta-analysis of limited concurrent studies, PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors appear to be associated with improved response rates, superior response durability and tolerable toxicity in patients with advanced melanoma.",26986169,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26986169/

However, there was some heterogeneity as well as some variation in the degree of benefit across studies. We reviewed randomized trials and performed a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors in comparison with conventional regimens. Eligible studies were limited to randomized controlled trials comparing anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 inhibitors to chemotherapy or vaccination treatment in adult patients with unresectable cutaneous metastatic melanoma. Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months was 28.5% versus 17.7% (RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.76-0.93), overall survival (OS) rate at 1 year was 51.2% versus 38.8% (RR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59-0.88), and overall response rate (ORR) at 6 months was 29.6% versus 17.7% (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76-0.95) favoring immune check point inhibitors over chemotherapies or vaccination. Immune check point inhibitors were associated with more frequent immune-related adverse events at 13.7% versus 2.4% of treated patients (RR: 6.74, 95% CI: 4.65-9.75). Subgroup analyses demonstrated significant PFS (RR: 0.92 vs. 0.74, P < 0.00001) and ORR (RR: 0.95 vs. 0.76, P = 0.0004) improvement with anti-PD-1 treatment compared to anti-CTLA-4 when each of them was compared to control treatments. Collectively, these results demonstrate that immune checkpoint inhibitors have superior outcomes compared to conventional chemotherapies or vaccination, and support the results of recent randomized trials that showed superior outcomes with anti-PD-1 agents over ipilimumab in unresectable metastatic cutaneous melanoma patients.",27167347,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27167347/

However, the adverse events due to BRAF and MEK inhibitors impact the physical comfort and social life of patients. Thus, in this study we have undertaken a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the efficacy and adverse events risk between monotherapy and combination therapy. We identified the relevant studies by searching PubMed, EMBASE and Google scholar databases, between the year January 2000 and May 2016. Based on the heterogeneity, the fixed- or random-effects models were employed to analyze the efficacy and the incidence rate of adverse events. In addition, the subgroup analyses were conducted to overcome the effects of heterogeneity. Finally, our study included five RCTs, involving 1730 patients for this meta-analysis. The fixed-effects model demonstrated that combination therapy of BRAF and MEK inhibition provided more survival benefit in terms of ORR, PFS and OS (P < 0.00001). But, the combination therapy also significantly increased the incidences of pyrexia, chills, vomiting, chorioretinopathy, retinal detachment, hypertension, night sweats, increased aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase levels (P < 0.05) as compared to monotherapy.

The overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR) and treatment adverse effects (AEs) were calculated. In total, 624 patients were included from 12 studies, including nine published studies and the results of three clinical trials. Radiotherapy combined with ICIs had a higher ORR compared with ICIs alone (35.00 vs. 20.39%). In terms of survival effect, radiotherapy combined with ICIs had no obvious advantage in OS. There was no statistically significant difference between 6-month and 12-month OS (P = 0.13; P = 0.69). There was no significant difference in PFS at 6 months (P = 0.08), but there was a significant difference in PFS at 12 months (P = 0.005). For patients with melanoma, radiotherapy combined with ICIs can improve the effective rate of treatment. Although there is no obvious OS advantage, it can improve PFS without serious adverse effects.

0,Melanoma,2022,"Antineoplastic Agents, Phytochemicals, Luteolin","Cutaneous malignant melanoma is the fastest growing and the most aggressive form of skin cancer that is diagnosed. However, its incidence is relatively scarce compared to the highest mortality rate of all skin cancers. The much more common skin cancers include nonmelanoma malignant skin cancers. Moreover, over the past several decades, the frequency of all skin cancers has increased much more dynamically than that of almost any other type of cancer. Among the available therapeutic options for skin cancers, chemotherapy used immediately after the surgical intervention has been an essential element. Unfortunately, the main problem with conventional chemopreventive regimens involves the lack of response to treatment and the associated side effects. Hence, there is a need for much more effective anticancer drugs. Correspondingly, the targeted alternatives have involved phytochemicals, which are safer chemotherapeutic agents and exhibit competitive anticancer activity with high therapeutic efficacy. Among polyphenolic compounds, some flavonoids and their derivatives, which are mostly found in medicinal plants, have been demonstrated to influence the modulation of signaling pathways at each stage of the carcinogenesis process, which is also important in the context of skin cancers. Hence, this review focuses on an exhaustive overview of the therapeutic effects of luteolin and its derivatives in the treatment and prevention of skin cancers.

0,Melanoma,2022,"Antineoplastic Agents, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors","Treatment strategies for malignant melanoma have rapidly evolved over the past decade. Because of its propensity to develop advanced stage and metastatic disease, melanoma has contributed to the majority of mortalities among patients with skin cancer. The development of novel therapeutics such as immunotherapy and targeted molecular therapies has revolutionized the treatment of patients with advanced stage and metastatic malignant melanoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and other revolutionary therapies have demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of this common malignancy. Along with these advancements in systemic therapies, imaging has continued to play a critical role in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with malignant melanoma. As the use of these novel therapies continues to expand, knowledge of the evolving therapeutic landscape of melanoma is becoming critical for radiologists. In this review, we provide a primer for radiologists outlining the evolution of immunotherapy and targeted therapy in the treatment of melanoma. We discuss the critical role of imaging in evaluation of treatment response, including a summary of current imaging response guidelines. Last, we summarize the essential role of imaging in the evaluation of potential adverse events seen in patients with malignant melanoma undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",35675685,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35675685/
0,Melanoma,2022,"Protein Kinase Inhibitors, Vemurafenib, EGFR protein, human, ErbB Receptors","Melanoma is considered one of the most aggressive skin cancers. It spreads and metastasizes quickly and is intrinsically resistant to most conventional chemotherapeutics, thereby presenting a challenge to researchers and clinicians searching for effective therapeutic strategies to treat patients with melanoma. The use of inhibitors of mutated serine/threonine-protein kinase B-RAF (BRAF), e.g., vemurafenib and dabrafenib, has revolutionized melanoma chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the response to these drugs lasts a limited time due to the development of acquired resistance. One of the proteins responsible for this process is epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this review, we summarize the role of EGFR signaling in the multidrug resistance of melanomas and discuss possible applications of EGFR inhibitors to overcome the development of drug resistance in melanoma cells during therapy.",35772580,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35772580/
0,Melanoma,2022,"Immunologic Factors, Nivolumab","Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized medical practice in oncology since the FDA approval of the first ICI 11 years ago. In light of this, Lymphocyte-Activation Gene 3 (LAG-3) is one of the most important next-generation immune checkpoint molecules, playing a similar role as Programmed cell Death protein 1 (PD-1) and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4). 19 LAG-3 targeting molecules are being evaluated at 108 clinical trials which are demonstrating positive results, including promising bispecific molecules targeting LAG-3 simultaneously with other ICIs. Recently, a new dual anti-PD-1 (Nivolumab) and anti-LAG-3 (Relatimab) treatment developed by Bristol Myers Squibb (Opdualag), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first LAG-3 blocking antibody combination for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. This novel immunotherapy combination more than doubled median progression-free survival (PFS) when compared to nivolumab monotherapy (10.1 months versus 4.6 months). Here, we analyze the large clinical trial responsible for this historical approval (RELATIVITY-047), and discuss the preclinical and clinical developments that led to its jump into clinical practice. We will also summarize results achieved by other LAG-3 targeting molecules with promising anti-tumor activities currently under clinical development in phases I, I/II, II, and III. Opdualag will boost the entry of more LAG-3 targeting molecules into clinical practice, supporting the accumulating evidence highlighting the pivotal role of LAG-3 in cancer.",35954196,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35954196/
0,Melanoma,2022,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,"The success of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for metastatic melanoma has generated considerable interest in the adjuvant setting, even though high-risk stage III melanoma (with or without in-transit metastases) still holds a substantial probability of relapse, despite surgical resection and available adjuvant treatments. Based on preclinical and clinical trials in resectable melanoma, immune checkpoint inhibitors can enhance anti-tumor immunity by activating antigen-specific T cells found in the primary site. These tumor-reactive T cells continue to exert their anti-tumor effects on remaining neoplastic cells after resection of the primary tumor, potentially preventing relapses from reoccurring. Several trials in the neoadjuvant setting have been conducted for melanoma patients using checkpoint inhibitors with promising early data, showing an improvement of operability and clinical outcomes. Hence, in this study, we review and discuss the available published and ongoing clinical trials to explore the scientific background behind immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant context.",34882516,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882516/
0,Melanoma,2022,"Antineoplastic Agents, Drug Carriers","Skin-cancer (SC) is more common than all other cancers affecting large percentage of the population in the world and is increasing in terms of morbidity and mortality. In the United States, 3million people are affected by SC annually whereas millions of people are affected globally. Melanoma is fifth most common cancer in the United States. SC is commonly occurred in white people as per WHO. SC is divided into two groups, i.e. melanoma and non-melanoma. In the previous two decades, management of cancer remains to be a tough and a challenging task for many scholars. Presently, the treatment protocols are mostly based on surgery and chemo-radiation therapy, which sooner or later harm the unaffected cells too. To reduce these limitations, nano scaled materials and its extensive range may be recognized as the probable carriers for the selective drug delivery in response to cancerous cells. Recently, the nanocarriers based drugs and their combinations were found to be a new and interesting approach of study for the management of skin carcinoma to enhance the effectiveness, to lessen the dose-dependent side effects and to avoid the drug resistance. This review may emphasize on the wide-range of information on nanotechnology-based drugs and their combination with physical techniques.",35294334,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294334/

It was subsequently shown to be inactivated in most malignant tumors, particularly at the protein level. Therefore, many activated oncogenes as well as inactivated tumor-suppressor genes inactivate the function of the RB protein. I hypothesized that most of the molecular-targeting agents against activated oncogenes may reactivate the function of RB, and proposed screening systems for agents up-regulating the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as p15, p27, and p21, which convert the phosphorylated inactive form of the RB protein to the unphosphorylated active form. I termed this screening as ""RB-reactivator screening"". Using the screening systems for agents that up-regulate the expression of p15, p27, and p21, we discovered the novel MEK inhibitor trametinib, the novel RAF/MEK inhibitor CH5126766/RO5126766/VS-6766, and the histone deacetylase inhibitor YM753/OBP-801, respectively. Trametinib exerted remarkable effects in patients with advanced BRAF mutant melanoma, and was approved in the USA as the first-in-class MEK inhibitor (trade name: Mekinist) in 2013. The British Pharmacological Society selected trametinib as the Drug Discovery of the Year in 2013. The combination of trametinib and the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib was approved for advanced BRAF mutant melanoma in the USA, EU, Japan, and many other countries. Additionally, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib in the treatment of patients with advanced BRAF mutant non-small cell lung cancer in 2015, and this combination was subsequently approved in the EU, USA, and Japan. In 2018, this combination was also approved for locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600-mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer in the USA after it had been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA. I describe here the characterization of our original screening system, RB-reactivator screening, by which these three molecular-targeting agents that advanced into clinical trials were identified.",35732246,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35732246/
0,Melanoma,2022,"Antineoplastic Agents, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase","In 1999 a visionary short article by The Wall Street Journal writers Robert Langreth and Michael Waldholz popularized the new term ""personalized medicine,"" that is to say, the targeting of drugs to each unique genetic profile. From today's perspective, targeted approaches have clearly found the widest use in the antineoplastic domain. The current review was initiated to review the progress that has been made regarding the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and brain metastases. PubMed was searched for the terms brain metastasis, brain metastases, or metastatic brain in the Title/Abstract. Selection was limited to randomized controlled trial (RCT) and publication date January 2010 to February 2022. Following visual review, 51 papers on metastatic lung cancer, 12 on metastatic breast cancer, and 9 on malignant melanoma were retained and underwent full analysis. Information was extracted from the papers giving specific numbers for intracranial response rate and/or overall survival. Since most pharmacological trials on advanced cancers excluded patients with brain metastases and since hardly any information on adjuvant radiotherapy and radiosurgery is available from the pharmacological trials, precise assessment of the effect of targeted medication for the subgroups with brain metastases is difficult. Some quantitative information regarding the success of targeted pharmacological therapy is only available for patients with breast and lung cancer and melanoma. Overall, targeted approaches approximately doubled the lifespan in the subgroups of brain metastases from tumors with targetable surface receptors such as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion receptor in non-small cell lung cancer or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. For these types, overall survival in the situation of brain metastases is now more than a year. For receptor-negative lung cancer and melanoma, introduction of immune checkpoint blockers brought a substantial advance, although overall survival for melanoma metastasized to the brain appears to remain in the range of 6 to 9 months. The outlook for small cell lung cancer metastasized to the brain apparently remains poor. The introduction of targeted therapy roughly doubled survival times of advanced cancers including those metastasized to the brain, but so far, targeted therapy does not differ essentially from chemotherapy, therefore also facing tumors developing escape mechanisms. With the improved perspective of patients suffering from brain metastases, it becomes important to further optimize treatment of this specific patient group within the framework of randomized trials.",35902427,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35902427/
0,Melanoma,2022,"Antineoplastic Agents, Immunoconjugates","While most skin malignancies are successfully treated with surgical excision, advanced and metastatic skin malignancies still often have poor long-term outcomes despite therapeutic advances. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) serve as a potentially promising novel therapeutic approach to treat advanced skin cancers as they combine antibody-associated antigen specificity with cytotoxic anti-tumor effects, thereby maximizing efficacy and minimizing systemic toxicity. While no ADCs have gained regulatory approval for advanced skin cancers, several promising agents are undergoing preclinical and clinical investigation. In addition to identifying and validating skin cancer antigen targets, the key to maximizing therapeutic success is the careful development of each component of the ADC complex: antibodies, cytotoxic drugs, and linkers. It is the optimization of each of these components that will be integral in overcoming resistance, maximizing safety, and improving long-term clinical outcomes.",36125618,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36125618/

It has been suggested that these microorganisms may be involved in carcinogenesis, cancer treatment response and resistance, as well as predisposition to adverse effects. In melanoma patients, one of the most immunogenic cancers, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and MAPK-targeted therapy-BRAF/MEK inhibitors-have revolutionized prognosis, and the study of the microbiome as a modulating factor is thus appealing. Although BRAF/MEK inhibitors constitute one of the main backbones of treatment in melanoma, little is known about their impact on GM and how this might correlate with immune re-induction. On the contrary, ICI and their relationship to GM has become an interesting field of research due to the already-known impact of immunotherapy in modulating the immune system. Immune reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment has been established as one of the main targets of microbiome, since it can induce immunosuppressive phenotypes, promote inflammatory responses or conduct anti-tumor responses. As a result, ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the role of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), as well as the impact of using dietary supplements, antibiotics and probiotics in the prediction of response to therapy. In this review, we provide an overview of GM's link to cancer, its relationship with the immune system and how this may impact response to treatments in melanoma patients. We also discuss insights about novel therapeutic approaches including FMT, changes in diet and use of probiotics, prebiotics and symbiotics. Finally, we hypothesize on the possible pathways through which GM may impact anti-tumor efficacy in melanoma patients treated with targeted therapy, an appealing subject of which little is known.",36233289,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36233289/

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) 1, an enzyme catabolizing tryptophan to kynurenine, creates an immunosuppressive environment in preclinical studies. Early phase clinical trials investigating inhibition of IDO1, especially together with checkpoint blockade, provided promising results. Unfortunately, the phase 3 trial of the IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat combined with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab did not show clinical benefit when compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with advanced malignant melanoma, which dampened enthusiasm for IDO inhibitors. Even so, several molecules, such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, were reported as additional potential targets for the modulation of the tryptophan pathway, which might enhance clinical effectiveness. Furthermore, the combination of IDO pathway blockade with agents inhibiting other signals, such as those generated by PIK3CA mutations that may accompany IDO1 upregulation, may be a novel way to enhance activity. Importantly, IDO1 expression level varies by tumor type and among patients with the same tumor type, suggesting that patient selection based on expression levels of IDO1 may be warranted in clinical trials.",36058143,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36058143/

Targeted inhibitors that act against kinases in the MAPK pathway are approved for BRAF-mutant metastatic cutaneous melanoma and increase patients' survival. Response to these therapies is limited by drug resistance and is less durable than with immune checkpoint inhibition. Conversely, rare melanoma subtypes have few therapeutic options for advanced disease and MAPK pathway targeting agents show minimal anti-tumor effects. Nevertheless, there is a future for targeted kinase inhibitors in melanoma: in new applications such as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy and in novel combinations with immunotherapies or other targeted therapies.
