0,Stomach Neoplasms,2017,"Antineoplastic Agents, ERBB2 protein, human, Receptor, ErbB-2, Trastuzumab","HER2-positive expression was associated with male gender, intestinal type, and well/moderate cell differentiation. We recommend that those gastric cancer patients who may benefit from trastuzumab treatment should be subjected to targeted therapies. However, detecting HER2 status may contribute to the target therapy for gastric carcinoma using trastuzumab. This would be strengthened by further studies incorporating comorbidity data, and outcomes from centralized programs.",29095284,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29095284/

0,Stomach Neoplasms,2017,"Angiogenesis Inhibitors, Antineoplastic Agents",The addition of AAs to standard therapy in mOGC improves OS. Improved efficacy was only observed in 2nd- or 3rd-line setting and not in 1st-line setting. Consistent OS benefit was present across all geographical regions. This benefit is at the expense of increased overall toxicity.,28222158,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28222158/
0,Stomach Neoplasms,2017,Antineoplastic Agents,"The optimal second- and third-line chemotherapy and targeted therapy for patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer is still a matter of debate. Therefore, a literature search was carried out in Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and oncology conferences until January 2016 for randomized controlled trials that compared second- or third-line therapy. We included 28 studies with 4810 patients. Second-line, single-agent taxane/irinotecan showed increased survival compared to best supportive care (BSC) (hazard ratio 0.65, 95 % confidence interval 0.53-0.79). Median survival gain ranged from 1.4 to 2.7 months among individual studies. Taxane- and irinotecan-based regimens showed equal survival benefit. Doublet chemotherapy taxane/irinotecan plus platinum and fluoropyrimidine was not different in survival, but showed increased toxicity vs. taxane/irinotecan monotherapy. Compared to BSC, second-line ramucirumab and second- or third-line everolimus and regorafenib showed limited median survival gain ranging from 1.1 to 1.4 months, and progression-free survival gain, ranging from 0.3 to 1.6 months. Third- or later-line apatinib showed increased survival benefit over BSC (HR 0.50, 0.32-0.79). Median survival gain ranged from 1.8 to 2.3 months. Compared to taxane-alone, survival was superior for second-line ramucirumab plus taxane (HR 0.81, 0.68-0.96), and olaparib plus taxane (HR 0.56, 0.35-0.87), with median survival gains of 2.2 and 4.8 months respectively. Targeted agents, either in monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy showed increased toxicity compared to BSC and chemotherapy-alone. This review indicates that, given the survival benefit in a phase III study setting, ramucirumab plus taxane is the preferred second-line treatment. Taxane or irinotecan monotherapy are alternatives, although the absolute survival benefit was limited. In third-line setting, apatinib monotherapy is preferred.

0,Stomach Neoplasms,2022,"Antibodies, Monoclonal, Antineoplastic Agents, ERBB2 protein, human, Immunoconjugates, Receptor, ErbB-2","Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), a combination of cytotoxic drugs and antibodies, have emerged as a rising star in cancer therapy. Disitamab vedotin (RC48), a novel ADC targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is currently being explored in a variety of malignancies. Compared with conventional HER2-targeting agents, RC48 is characterized by a wider therapeutic window and less toxicity to normal tissues. In this review, we will analyze the structural elements and mechanisms of RC48. Besides, we provide a landscape on the progression of RC48 in common malignancies, focusing on RC48 in gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, and a brief overview of urothelial, breast and other cancers (e.g., gynecological cancer, biliary tract cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and myometrial invasive bladder cancer). Finally, we will also discuss future challenges in the development of RC48 and future directions to improve efficacy.",36305543,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36305543/

0,Stomach Neoplasms,2022,Antineoplastic Agents,"Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. Although surgery is the primary treatment, serious maladies that dissipate to other parts of the body may require chemotherapy. As there is no effective procedure to treat stomach cancer, natural small molecules are a current focus of research interest for the development of better therapeutics. Chemotherapy is usually used as a last resort for people with advanced stomach cancer. Anti-colon cancer chemotherapy has become increasingly effective due to drug resistance and sensitivity across a wide spectrum of drugs. Naturally-occurring substances have been widely acknowledged as an important project for discovering innovative medications, and many therapeutic pharmaceuticals are made from natural small molecules. Although the beneficial effects of natural products are as yet unknown, emerging data suggest that several natural small molecules could suppress the progression of stomach cancer. Therefore, the underlying mechanism of natural small molecules for pathways that are directly involved in the pathogenesis of cancerous diseases is reviewed in this article. Chemotherapy and molecularly-targeted drugs can provide hope to colon cancer patients. New discoveries could help in the fight against cancer, and future stomach cancer therapies will probably include molecularly formulated drugs.",36080453,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36080453/
0,Stomach Neoplasms,2022,"Antineoplastic Agents, B7-H1 Antigen, Trastuzumab","In recent years, advances of anticancer and supportive therapies have determined a gradual improvement in survival rates and patients' general conditions in metastatic gastric cancer (mGC), allowing them to receive further treatments. The choice of treatment is driven by performance status, age, stage of disease, number of metastatic sites and time from the first to third line of treatment. Targets such as microsatellite instability, PD-L1 expression, and HER2 overexpression or amplification may be addressed to personalise treatment and prolong survival. Despite a growing number of third line options that have provided clinicians with greater opportunities to customise treatments, up to date few agents have been demonstrated as effective after two standard lines for mGC; for these reasons, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy were all widely investigated in both phase II and phase III studies. Overall, TAS-102, apatinib, regorafenib, nilotinib, trastuzumab, and pembrolizumab were demonstrated to be valid options in the third line scenario for mGC patient refractory to at least two lines of therapy. A multimodal approach based on chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted agents, a personalised nutritional programme as well as the research of new predictive biomarkers may pave the way to new strategies to identify the best treatment for each patient.",36135075,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36135075/

Celastrol (CEL) is a well-known natural product with antineoplastic activity. In this study, pyrazole analogues were introduced at the C-29 position of CEL. A total of 24 new derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their mechanism and antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Among them, compound <b>21</b> exhibited the best activity against BGC-823 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.21 ± 0.01 μM). Further biological studies showed that <b>21</b> significantly raised the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels to activate the apoptotic pathway, causing mitochondrial dysfunction in BGC-823 cells. In addition, <b>21</b> also arrested cells in the G2/M phase to induce tumor cell apoptosis. In a nude mouse tumor xenograft model, <b>21</b> exhibited a better tumor inhibition rate (89.85%) than CEL (inhibition rate 76.52%). Taken together, the present study has provided an anticancer lead compound candidate, <b>21</b>, and has revealed that increased ROS generation may be an effective strategy in the treatment of GC.",35536757,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35536757/
0,Stomach Neoplasms,2022,"Antineoplastic Agents, Fluorouracil","Neocryptolepine derivatives have attracted great interest because of their unique cytotoxic activity. 8-Fluoroneocryptolepine (8FNC) was synthesized, and its cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay in AGS gastric cancer cells and gastric mucosa GES-1 cells. 8-Fluoroneocryptolepine showed greater selectivity and cytotoxicity to AGS cells than the cisplatin (CIS) and fluorouracil (5-Fu) commonly used in clinical treatment of gastric cancer. Most importantly, we significantly improved the cytotoxic effect of 8FNC against AGS cells by structural modification and reduced the cytotoxicity against GES-1 cells compared with neocryptolepine. We further evaluated the activity of 8FNC against AGS cells <i>in vitro</i>. Our results indicate that 8FNC arrests the AGS cell cycle in the G2/M phase, reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential of AGS cells, and drives the initiation of apoptotic body formation in 8FNC-induced apoptosis. Moreover, 8FNC exhibits strong inhibitory effects on AGS cell migration. Studies on the molecular mechanisms of the cytotoxic activities of 8FNC revealed that it may play a significant role in the inhibitory effect on AGS human gastric cancer cells through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In conclusion, 8FNC may become a promising lead compound in the development of potential clinical drug candidates for the treatment of gastric cancer.",35191714,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35191714/
