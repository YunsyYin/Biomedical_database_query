Glucocorticoid and chemotherapeutic agents have largely extended lives of these patients. However, serious side effects and drug resistance often limit the prognosis of considerable number of the patients. The efficient treatment of autoimmune diseases or T-ALL with drug resistance remains an important unmet demand clinically. Bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids tetrandrine and cepharanthine have been applied for the treatment of certain types of autoimmune diseases and cancers, while studies on their action mechanisms and their further applications combined with glucocorticoids or chemotherapeutic agents remains to be expanded. This review introduced molecular mechanisms of tetrandrine and cepharanthine in T cells, including their therapeutic implications. Both tetrandrine and cepharnthine influence the growth of activated T cells via several kinds of signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, caspase cascades, cell cycle, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR. According to recent preclinical and clinical studies, P-glycoprotein inhibitory effect of tetrandrine and cepharnthine could play a significant role on T cell-involved refractory diseases. Therefore, tetrandrine or cepharanthine combined with glucocorticoid or other anti-leukemia drugs would bring a new hope for patients with glucocorticoid-resistant autoimmune disease or refractory T-ALL accompanied with functional P-glycoprotein. In conclusion, bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids tetrandrine and cepharanthine can regulate several signaling pathways in abnormally activated T cells with low toxicity. Bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids deserve to be paid more attention as a lead compound to develop new drugs for the treatment of T cell-involved diseases in the future.",32800789,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32800789/

L‑asparaginase acts by depleting plasma L‑asparagine, which is essential to the survival of leukemia cells. In contrast to normal cells, tumor cells cannot synthesize L‑asparagine and thus depend on its external uptake for growth. Currently, three bacterial L‑asparaginases are used in therapy; however, they are associated with severe side‑effects related to high toxicity and immunogenicity. The introduction of human L‑asparaginase‑like protein 1 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment would avoid the problems caused by the bacterial enzymes; however, a major difficulty in the therapeutic use of the human enzyme comes from the fact that human L‑asparaginase must be activated through an autoprocessing step, which is a low‑efficiency process in vitro that results in reduced enzymatic activity.

Aims To assess the efficacy and safety of blinatumomab as first salvage versus second or later salvage in patients with r/r BCP ALL. Materials & Methods Patient-level pooled data were used for this analysis. In total, 532 adults with r/r BCP ALL treated with blinatumomab were included (first salvage, n = 165; second or later salvage, n = 367). Results Compared with patients who received blinatumomab as second or later salvage, those who received blinatumomab as first salvage had a longer median overall survival (OS; 10.4 vs. 5.7 months; HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.26-1.97; P < .001) and relapse-free survival (10.1 vs. 7.3 months; HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.98-1.93; P = .061), and higher rates of remission (n = 89 [54%] vs. n = 150 [41%]; odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41-0.85; P = .005), minimal residual disease response (n = 68 [41%] vs. n = 118 [32%]), and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) realization (n = 60 [36%] vs. n = 88 [24%]), and alloHSCT in continuous remission (n = 33 [20%] vs. n = 52 (14%]). In a subgroup analysis, there was no apparent effect of prior alloHSCT on median OS in either salvage group. The safety profile of blinatumomab was generally similar between the groups; however, cytokine release syndrome, febrile neutropenia, and infection were more frequent with second or later salvage than with first salvage.

The T-ALL event-free survival rate (EFS) is 85%. The evaluation of structural and numerical chromosomal changes is important for a comprehensive biological characterization of T-ALL, but there are currently no genetic prognostic markers. Despite chemotherapy regimens, steroids, and allogeneic transplantation, relapse is the main problem in children with T-ALL. Due to the development of high-throughput molecular methods, the ability to define subgroups of T-ALL has significantly improved in the last few years. The profiling of the gene expression of T-ALL has led to the identification of T-ALL subgroups, and it is important in determining prognostic factors and choosing an appropriate treatment. Novel therapies targeting molecular aberrations offer promise in achieving better first remission with the hope of preventing relapse. The employment of precisely targeted therapeutic approaches is expected to improve the cure of the disease and quality of life of patients. These include therapies that inhibit Notch1 activation (bortezomib), JAK inhibitors in ETP-ALL (ruxolitinib), BCL inhibitors (venetoclax), and anti-CD38 therapy (daratumumab).

0,Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma,2021,Antineoplastic Agents,"5-year overall survival rates have surpassed 90% for childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia, but survivors are at risk for permanent health sequelae. Although event-free survival appropriately represents the outcome for cancers with poor overall survival, this metric is inadequate when cure rates are high but challenged by serious, persistent complications. Accordingly, a group of experts in paediatric haematology-oncology, representative of 17 international acute lymphocytic leukaemia study groups, launched an initiative to construct a measure, designated severe toxicity-free survival (STFS), to quantify the occurrence of physician-prioritised toxicities to be integrated with standard cancer outcome reporting. Five generic inclusion criteria (not present before cancer diagnosis, symptomatic, objectifiable, of unacceptable severity, permanent, or requiring unacceptable treatments) were used to assess 855 health conditions, which resulted in inclusion of 21 severe toxicities. Consensus definitions were reached through a modified Delphi process supplemented by two additional plenary meetings. The 21 severe toxicities include severe adverse health conditions that substantially affect activities of daily living and are refractory to therapy (eg, refractory seizures), are without therapeutic options (eg, blindness), or require substantially invasive treatment (eg, cardiac transplantation). Incorporation of STFS assessment into clinical trials has the potential to improve and diversify treatment strategies, focusing not only on traditional outcome events and overall survival but also the frequencies of the most severe toxicities. The two major aims of this Review were to: prioritise and define unacceptable long-term toxicity for patients with childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia, and define how these toxicities should be combined into a composite quantity to be integrated with other reported outcomes. Although STFS quantifies the clinically unacceptable health tradeoff for cure using childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia as a model disease, the prioritised severe toxicities are based on generic considerations of relevance to any other cancer diagnosis and age group.",34171282,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34171282/

0,Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma,2021,"Amino Acids, Dietary Proteins, Asparaginase","Malignant cells often demonstrate a proliferative advantage when compared to non-malignant cells. However, the rapid growth and metabolism required for survival can also highlight vulnerabilities specific to these malignant cells. One such vulnerability exhibited by cancer is an increased demand for amino acids (AAs), which often results in a dependency on exogenous sources of AAs or requires upregulation of de novo synthesis. These metabolic alterations can be exploited by therapy, which aims to improve treatment outcome and decrease relapse and reoccurrence. One clinically utilised strategy targeting AA dependency is the use of asparaginase in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), which results in a depletion of exogenous asparagine and subsequent cancer cell death. Examples of other successful strategies include the exploitation of arginine deiminase and methioninase, nutrient restriction of methionine and the inhibition of glutaminase. In this review, we summarise these treatment strategies into three promising avenues: AA restriction, enzymatic depletion and inhibition of metabolism.

However, despite the clear clinical and biological benefits of asparaginase therapy, many patients experience toxicities. A well-known treatment-limiting toxicity is asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP). If severe, it necessitates discontinuation of asparaginase therapy, which can lead to a higher risk of relapse in patients with ALL. New protocols for ALL therapy have increased overall total doses of asparaginase therapy in select high-risk populations and have incorporated longer half-life formulations of pegylated asparaginase. Treatment drug monitoring has also allowed assurance of adequate levels of asparagine depletion throughout treatment. It is currently unknown if these changes will increase rates of AAP. Interestingly, important pharmacogenomics data, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, can identify patients at the highest risk for severe AAP.

Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the drugs of choice in the therapy of Ph+ ALL. In combination with standard chemotherapy, TKIs have markedly improved the outcome of Ph+ ALL, in particular if this treatment is followed by bone marrow transplantation. However, resistance to TKIs develops with high frequency, causing leukemia relapse that results in <5-year overall survival. Thus, new therapies are needed to address relapsed/TKI-resistant Ph+ ALL. We have shown that expression of cell cycle regulatory kinase CDK6, but not of the highly related CDK4 kinase, is required for the proliferation and survival of Ph+ ALL cells. Comparison of leukemia suppression induced by treatment with the clinically-approved dual CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib versus CDK6 silencing revealed that the latter treatment was markedly more effective, probably reflecting inhibition of CDK6 kinase-independent effects. Thus, we developed CDK4/6-targeted proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that preferentially degrade CDK6 over CDK4. One compound termed PROTAC YX-2-107, which degrades CDK6 by recruiting the Cereblon ubiquitin ligase, markedly suppressed leukemia burden in mice injected with de novo or TKI-resistant Ph+ ALL. The effect of PROTAC YX-2-107 was comparable or superior to that of palbociclib. The development of CDK6-selective PROTACs represents an effective strategy to exploit the ""CDK6 dependence"" of Ph+ ALL cells while sparing a high proportion of normal hematopoietic progenitors that depend on both CDK6 and CDK6 for their survival. In combination with other agents, CDK6-selective PROTACs may be valuable components of chemotherapy-free protocols for the therapy of Ph+ ALL and other CDK6-dependent hematological malignancies.",34573335,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34573335/

In this review, we summarize the mechanism of action and the related research data obtained with JZP-458 for the treatment of ALL or LBL.",35670704,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35670704/
0,Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma,2022,"Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized, Antineoplastic Agents, Inotuzumab Ozogamicin","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive blood cancer that affects both children and adults. Although the majority of children diagnosed with ALL are now cured and outcomes are improving for younger adults, older adults diagnosed with ALL usually succumb to their disease. Traditional chemotherapy regimens are poorly tolerated and ineffective in most older adults. Recently, novel chemotherapy agents such as inotuzumab ozogamicin and venetoclax have been successfully combined with dose reduced chemotherapy (mini-hyper-CVD) with promising results. Further study is needed to define the optimal combination and sequencing of novel agents and chemotherapy for different patient populations. This review discusses the challenge of treating older adults with traditional chemotherapy, experience to date with novel agents in combination with mini-hyper-CVD, as well as future directions and unanswered questions.",34996739,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34996739/

0,Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma,2022,Asparaginase,"A wider use of L-asparaginase in the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia has improved cure rates during recent decades and hence led to introduction of pediatric-inspired treatment protocols for adolescents and young adults. In parallel, a range of burdensome, often severe and occasionally life-threatening toxicities have become frequent, including hypersensitivity, hepatotoxicity, hypertriglyceridemia, thromboembolism, pancreatitis, and osteonecrosis. This often leads to truncation of asparaginase therapy, which at least in the pediatric population has been clearly associated with a higher risk of leukemic relapse. Many of the asparaginase induced toxicities are far more common in older patients, but since their relapse rate is still unsatisfactory, the decision to discontinue asparaginase therapy should balance the risk of toxicity with continued asparaginase therapy against the risk of relapse in the individual patient. The underlying mechanisms of most of the asparaginase induced side effects are still unclear. In this review we address the individual toxicities, known risk factors, and their clinical management.",34511319,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34511319/
0,Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma,2022,"Antineoplastic Agents, Asparaginase","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. Bacterial L-asparaginase has played an important role in ALL treatment for several decades; however, hypersensitivity reactions to Escherichia coli-derived asparaginases often preclude their use. Inability to receive asparaginase due to hypersensitivities is associated with poor patient outcomes. Erwinia chrysanthemi-derived asparaginase (ERW) is an effective, non-cross-reactive treatment option, but is limited in supply. Consequently, alternative asparaginase preparations are needed to ensure asparaginase availability for patients with hypersensitivities. Recombinant technology can potentially address this unmet need by programming cells to produce recombinant asparaginase. JZP-458, a recombinant Erwinia asparaginase derived from a novel Pseudomonas fluorescens expression platform with no immunologic cross-reactivity to E. coli-derived asparaginases, has the same primary amino acid sequence as ERW, with comparable activity based on in vitro measurements. The efficient manufacturing of JZP-458 would provide an additional asparaginase preparation for patients with hypersensitivities.",34105243,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34105243/
