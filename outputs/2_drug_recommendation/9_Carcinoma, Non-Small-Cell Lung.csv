Clinical benefits of gefitinib administration in NSCLC patients have been observed in clinical practice, but the extent of the pulmonary toxicity of gefitinib in patients with advanced NSCLC remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the overall incidence and risk of gefitinib-related pulmonary toxicity in advanced NSCLC patients. Relevant trials were identified from the databases of Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and the clinicaltrials.gov of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The outcomes included the overall incidence, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Fixed-effects models were used in the statistical analyses according to the heterogeneity of the included studies. According to the data from the included trials, the overall incidence of high-grade hemoptysis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) was 0.49% (95% CI: 0.24%-0.99%), 2.33% (95% CI: 1.47%-3.66%), 2.24% (95% CI: 1.34%-3.72%), and 1.43% (95% CI: 0.98%-2.09%), respectively. The pooled ORs of high-grade hemoptysis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, and ILD were 1.73 (95% CI: 0.46-6.52; P = 0.42), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.66-1.49; P = 0.95), 4.70 (95% CI: 1.48-14.95; P = 0.0087), and 2.64 (95% CI: 1.22-5.69; P = 0.01), respectively. Gefitinib was associated with a significantly increased risk of high-grade/fatal ILD and pneumonitis compared with the controls, whereas the risk of other high-grade pulmonary events (pneumonia and hemoptysis) was not significant. Careful surveillance of gefitinib-related pulmonary toxicity is critical for the safe use of this drug.",26945426,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26945426/

To date, the golden standard for detection of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We performed a pooled-data analysis on the diagnostic operating characteristics of immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We searched Embase, Pubmed, and Springer databases. The results of IHC were evaluated using a modified H-score. We used a 2-level bivariate meta-analysis following a random effect model to summarize sensitivity and specificity and fit hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic curves. We also performed sensitivity analysis using different antibodies to investigate potential heterogeneity. Twelve studies consisting of a total of 3754 NSCLC specimens were analyzed. When we defined 1+/2+/3+, 2+/3+, and 3+ as ALK positive, we found the sensitivities to be 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 97%-100%), 86% (95% CI, 73%-93%), and 56% (95% CI, 36%-74%) and the specificities to be 98% (95% CI, 95%-99%), 99% (95% CI, 99%-100%), and 100% (95% CI, 100%-100%), respectively. We demonstrated that when defining 3+ as positive and 0 as negative the sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 100%. In our sensitivity analysis, we found the sensitivity of D5F3 and 5A4 antibodies to be much higher than that of ALK1. We concluded that IHC scores 0 and 3+ were nearly 100% concordant with FISH-negative and FISH-positive status, respectively. However, IHC scores 1+ and 2+ might require further confirmatory testing by FISH assay. IHC assay using D5F3 and 5A4 antibodies reliably detected NSCLC with ALK rearrangement and may be useful as a screening method to identify these tumors.

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize existing studies with direct comparisons of EGFR TKIs in NSCLC in terms of both efficacy and safety. Eight randomized trials and 82 cohort studies with a total of 17,621 patients were included for analysis. Gefitinib and erlotinib demonstrated comparable effects on progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.04), overall survival (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.06), overall response rate (risk ratio [RR], 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.11), and disease control rate (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.01), which did not vary considerably with EGFR mutation status, ethnicity, line of treatment, and baseline brain metastasis status. Gefitinib was associated with more grade 3/4 liver dysfunction, but tended to cause lower rates of dose reduction, treatment discontinuation, total grade 3/4 adverse events (RR, 0.78; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.94), and a number of specific adverse events such as rash and diarrhea. No solid evidence was found that afatinib had greater efficacy than gefitinib or erlotinib in first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC. However, afatinib was more effective than erlotinib as second-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma.

Intercalated administration could avoid the reduction of chemotherapy activity due to G<sub>1</sub> cell-cycle arrest from EGFR-TKIs. A PubMed search was performed in December 2015 and updated in February 2016. The references from the selected studies were also checked to identify additional eligible trials. Furthermore, the proceedings of the main international meetings were searched from 2010 onward. We included RCTs comparing chemotherapy intercalated with an EGFR-TKI versus chemotherapy alone for patients with advanced NSCLC. Ten RCTs were eligible (6 with erlotinib, 4 with gefitinib): 39% of patients had a known EGFR mutational status, 43% of whom EGFR mutation positive. The intercalated combination was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.95; P = .01), progression-free survival (PFS; HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.53-0.68; P < .00001), and objective response rate (ORR; odds ratio [OR], 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08-3.49; P < .00001).

The overall analysis found that increased EGFR gene copy number was associated with higher overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS; p values ≤0.008) compared with patients without a high EGFR gene copy number. Subgroup analysis found that in a population of patients who were primarily Caucasian, a higher EGFR gene copy number was also associated with increased ORR, OS, and PFS (p values ≤0.018). The results were similar in a population of Asian patients, except that a higher EGFR gene copy number was not associated with improved OS (p=0.248). Sensitivity analysis indicated that no one study overly influenced the results and that the findings are robust.

Recent research has reported contradictory results on the association between sarcopenia and the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate this discrepancy. We systematically searched three electronic databases to identify articles reporting on the association between sarcopenia and treatment outcomes in patients with solid cancers who received ICIs. The outcomes assessed were hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and odds ratios (ORs) for objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and toxicity. Pooled estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A total of 2501 patients from 26 studies were analysed. Sarcopenia was observed in 44.7% (95% CI: 38.2-51.3) of the patients and was significantly associated with poor survival (HR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.32-1.82 for OS and HR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.35 to 1.93 for PFS). The HRs (95% CIs) for OS according to the diagnostic measures used were 1.97 (0.88-4.41) for psoas muscle index (PMI), 1.41 (0.87-2.28) for skeletal muscle density (SMD), and 1.43 (1.23-1.67) for skeletal mass index (SMI). The HRs (95% CIs) for PFS were 1.86 (1.08-3.21) for PMI, 1.27 (0.94-1.71) for SMD, and 1.38 (1.11-1.71) for SMI.

The ORs for ORR (95% CIs) were 0.56 (0.15-2.05) for PMI and 0.78 (0.56-1.09) for SMI.

In contrast, the occurrence of severe toxicity was not associated with sarcopenia (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.51-2.52). Poor survival and poor response in patients with sarcopenia indicate a negative association between sarcopenia and efficacy of ICIs.

It may occur through various mechanisms, such as MET overexpression or gene amplification or mutation, all of which can be detected by specific methods. The utility of MET overexpression as a biomarker remains unclear due to discrepancies in its occurrence and non-standardized cut-off thresholds. MET exon 14 skipping mutation (METex14) was established as a strong predictor of response to selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and clinical trial results in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 led to the approval of capmatinib and tepotinib by regulatory agencies worldwide. MET amplification is an emerging biomarker, with clinical data indicating an association between MET gene copy number and response to MET-TKIs. Additionally, MET amplification represents an important mechanism of resistance to TKIs in oncogene-driven NSCLC. The identification of molecular alterations for which targeted therapies are available is important, and high-throughput next-generation sequencing techniques can provide information on multiple genes at the same time, helping to provide valuable predictive information for oncogene-driven cancers. This review summarizes the current methods used for the detection of METex14, MET amplification and MET overexpression, and discusses the evidence for the use of MET-TKIs in patients with NSCLC with MET dysregulation.

Indeed, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) monotherapy or in combination represent the standard-of-care for patients with advanced disease with no actionable mutation. Due to the unique action of ICI to potentiate the immune system, conventional response assessment criteria in medical imaging, such as RECIST 1.1, have limitations. Unlike chemotherapy, patients treated with ICI can present atypical response patterns including pseudoprogression, hyper-progression, and dissociated response. Therefore, the creation and implementation of novel standardized response criteria that consider these distinct response patterns is of critical importance. In parallel, FDG PET/CT is now part of the routine staging for patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer. Moreover, there is an increasing interest in using FDG PET/CT metrics for predicting response to ICI therapy. While standardized uptake values are limited in predicting outcomes, new metrics including tumor metabolic volume, total lesion glycolysis, metabolic activity of the gut microbiome, and radiomics show promise as potential nuclear-medicine ICI biomarkers. Moreover, PET tracers that specifically target immune checkpoints such as PD-L1 also showed promising results in predicting ICI response. Finally, despite achieving higher response rates, ICI therapy leads to the development of immune-related adverse events such as pneumonitis or colitis. Therefore, it is of upmost importance for the imaging specialist to recognize the metabolic patterns associated with these new toxicity profiles. In this paper, we will review how the FDG PET/CT can potentially become a useful marker for the evaluation of ICI response.",35636978,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35636978/

These efforts have led to the development and regulatory approval of three BRAF inhibitors as well as five combinations of a BRAF inhibitor plus an additional agent(s) to manage cancer such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer, and colorectal cancer. To date, each regimen is effective only in patients with tumors harboring BRAFV600 mutations and the duration of benefit is often short-lived. Further limitations preventing optimal management of BRAF-mutant malignancies are that treatments of non-V600 BRAF mutations have been less profound and combination therapy is likely necessary to overcome resistance mechanisms, but multi-drug regimens are often too toxic. With the emergence of a deeper understanding of how BRAF mutations signal through the RAS/MAPK pathway, newer RAF inhibitors are being developed that may be more effective and potentially safer and more rational combination therapies are being tested in the clinic.
