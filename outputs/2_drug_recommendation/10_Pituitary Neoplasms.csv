Repeat pituitary surgery, bilateral adrenalectomy, and radiation have limitations with respect to efficacy and/or side effects. Therefore, there is a clear need for an effective medical treatment. The studies reviewed here suggest a role for pituitary-directed therapies, applying multireceptor ligand somatostatin analogs like pasireotide or second-generation dopamine agonists. Retinoic acid has been also studied in a small prospective study. These compounds target ACTH-secretion at the pituitary level and possibly inhibit corticotrope proliferation. Specific side effects of these compounds need to be considered, especially when used as long-term therapy. These novel approaches could provide options for treatment of patients in whom surgery has failed or is not possible, and while awaiting effects of radiation therapy. Preoperative use to decrease cortisol excess, potentially reducing perioperative complications, needs to be further studied.",25627118,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25627118/

However, some pituitary tumors exhibit clinically aggressive behavior that is characterized by tumor recurrence and continued progression despite repeated treatments with conventional surgical, radiation and medical therapies. More recently, temozolomide, a second generation oral alkylating agent, has shown therapeutic promise for aggressive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas with favorable clinical and radiographic responses. Temozolomide causes DNA damage by methylation of the O(6) position of guanine, which results in potent cytotoxic DNA adducts and consequently, tumor cell apoptosis. The degree of MGMT expression appears to be inversely related to therapeutic responsiveness to temozolomide with a significant number of temozolomide-sensitive pituitary tumors exhibiting low MGMT expression. The presence of high MGMT expression appears to mitigate the effectiveness of temozolomide and this has been used as a marker in several studies to predict the efficacy of temozolomide. Recent evidence also suggests that mutations in mismatch repair proteins such as MSH6 could render pituitary tumors resistant to temozolomide. In this article, the authors review the development of temozolomide, its biochemistry and interaction with O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), its role in adjuvant treatment of aggressive pituitary neoplasms, and future works that could influence the efficacy of temozolomide therapy.

0,Pituitary Neoplasms,2016,"Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating, Dacarbazine, Temozolomide","Improved imaging techniques have contributed to increased diagnosis of pituitary tumors. These tumor types can be microadenomas or macroadenomas and can either be functional or non-functional. Atypical or aggressive pituitary adenomas are tumors that rapidly increase in size and may invade into the suprasellar or parasellar regions. They are characterized by a Ki-67 nuclear labeling index greater than 10 %. Management of these tumors is difficult, and many recur after surgery. Temozolomide, a second generation alkylating agent, has been showing promising results in the treatment of these tumors. The patient was a 39-year-old male diagnosed with an invasive silent somatotroph pituitary macroadenoma treated with temozolomide after surgery.

0,Pituitary Neoplasms,2016,"Dopamine Agonists, Transforming Growth Factor beta1, Estradiol, Prolactin, Dopamine","Prolactinomas are the most frequently observed pituitary adenomas and most of them respond well to conventional treatment with dopamine agonists (DAs). However, a subset of prolactinomas fails to respond to such therapies and is considered as DA-resistant prolactinomas (DARPs). New therapeutic approaches are necessary for these tumors. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) is a known inhibitor of lactotroph cell proliferation and prolactin secretion, and it partly mediates dopamine inhibitory action. TGFβ1 is secreted to the extracellular matrix as an inactive latent complex, and its bioavailability is tightly regulated by different components of the TGFβ1 system including latent binding proteins, local activators (thrombospondin-1, matrix metalloproteases, integrins, among others), and TGFβ receptors. Pituitary TGFβ1 activity and the expression of different components of the TGFβ1 system are regulated by dopamine and estradiol. Prolactinomas (animal models and humans) present reduced TGFβ1 activity as well as reduced expression of several components of the TGFβ1 system. Therefore, restoration of TGFβ1 inhibitory activity represents a novel therapeutic approach to bypass dopamine action in DARPs. The aim of this review is to summarize the large literature supporting TGFβ1 important role as a local modulator of pituitary lactotroph function and to provide recent evidence of the restoration of TGFβ1 activity as an effective treatment in experimental prolactinomas.

A phase III trial of oral octreotide capsules demonstrated that this treatment can safely sustain suppressed levels of GH and IGF-1 and reduce the severity of symptoms in patients with acromegaly previously controlled by injectable SRL therapy, with the added benefit of no injection-site reactions. Phase I and phase II trials of the pan-selective SRL DG3173, the liquid crystal octreotide depot CAM2029 and an antisense oligonucleotide directed against the GH receptor have shown that these agents can be used to achieve biochemical suppression in acromegaly and have favourable safety profiles.

Here, we present new clinical data and a systematic review of the scientific literature showing that the prevalence of cabergoline-associated valvulopathy is very low. We prospectively assessed 40 patients with prolactinoma taking cabergoline. Cardiovascular examination before echocardiography detected an audible systolic murmur in 10% of cases (all were functional murmurs), and no clinically significant valvular lesion was shown on echocardiogram in the 90% of patients without a murmur. Our systematic review identified 21 studies that assessed the presence of valvular abnormalities in patients with prolactinoma treated with cabergoline. Including our new clinical data, only two (0·11%) of 1811 patients were confirmed to have cabergoline-associated valvulopathy (three [0·17%] if possible cases were included). The probability of clinically significant valvular heart disease is low in the absence of a murmur. On the basis of these findings, we challenge the present recommendations to do routine echocardiography in all patients taking cabergoline for prolactinoma every 12 months. We propose that such patients should be screened by a clinical cardiovascular examination and that echocardiogram should be reserved for those patients with an audible murmur, those treated for more than 5 years at a dose of more than 3 mg per week, or those who maintain cabergoline treatment after the age of 50 years.

Imaging and laboratory confirmed the diagnosis of GH secreting macroadenoma. She started medical treatment with a somatostatin analogue and a dopamine agonist. During an 8-year follow-up period, a good clinical control of the disease and a shrinkage of the adenoma have been demonstrated. At the last observation she achieved normal near-adult height and pubertal development.

For these patients, chemotherapy is an additional treatment option that could improve outcomes. Temozolomide is an oral chemotherapy with a favorable side-effect profile that has shown activity against pituitary adenomas.

0,Pituitary Neoplasms,2017,"Antineoplastic Agents, Peptides, Cyclic, lanreotide, Somatostatin, pasireotide, Octreotide","Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that arises when the pituitary gland secretes excess growth hormone (GH), which in turn stimulates a concomitant increase in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels. Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) constitute a heterogeneous group of tumours that can secrete serotonin and a variety of peptide hormones that may cause characteristic symptoms known as carcinoid syndrome or other symptoms and hormonal hypersecretion syndromes depending on the tumour's site of origin. Current medical therapy for the treatment of acromegaly and GEP-NET involves the administration of somatostatin analogues that effectively suppress excess hormone secretion. After its discovery in 1979, octreotide became the first synthetic biologically stable somatostatin analogue with a short-acting formulation of octreotide introduced into clinical practice in the late 1980s. Lanreotide, another somatostatin analogue, became available in the mid-1990s initially as a prolonged-release formulation administered every 10 or 14 days. Long-acting release formulations of both octreotide (Sandostatin LAR and Novartis) and lanreotide (Somatuline Autogel, Ipsen), based on microparticle and nanoparticle drug-delivery technologies, respectively, were later developed, which allowed for once-monthly administration and improved convenience. First-generation somatostatin analogues remain one of the cornerstones of medical therapy in the management of pituitary and GEP-NET hormone hypersecretion, with octreotide having the longest established efficacy and safety profile of the somatostatin analogue class. More recently, pasireotide (Signifor), a next-generation multireceptor-targeted somatostatin analogue, has emerged as an alternative therapeutic option for the treatment of acromegaly. This review summarizes the development and clinical success of somatostatin analogues.",27697899,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27697899/

Prolactinomas usually respond well to dopamine agonists (DA) as first-line therapy. However, treatment resistance remains a concern. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent that has shown promise in treating aggressive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas that are resistant to other therapies. To date, no control trials have been undertaken and only single case reports of pituitary tumors treated with TMZ have been published. A systematic literature search was conducted for studies reporting the use of TMZ for the treatment of prolactinomas that were resistant to standard therapy. In total, 42 reported cases were identified and included in our analysis: 23 cases of prolactin-secreting adenomas and 19 of prolactin-secreting carcinomas. Prior to TMZ administration, patients had exhibited tumor progression and had previously undergone various treatments including surgery, radiotherapy, and drug therapy. Tumor shrinkage was reported in 76% of patients. Reduced prolactin levels were observed in 75% of patients, while normalization of prolactin was reported in 8%. TMZ failure occurred in 20.6% of cases. Most patients exhibited no serious adverse effects.

Recently, an increasing number of reports emphasized DAs' psychological side effects, either de novo or as exacerbations of prior psychiatric disease. Methods Review of prospective and retrospective studies (PubMed 1976, September 2018) evaluating the psychological profile of DA-treated patients with hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas. Case series and case reports of psychiatric complications were also reviewed. Results Most studies were cross-sectional and had a control group of healthy volunteers or patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. There were few prospective studies, with/without control group, that included small numbers of patients. Compared with controls, patients with hyperprolactinemia generally had worse quality of life, anxiety, depression and certain personality traits. Patients receiving DAs had higher impulsivity scores than normoprolactinemic controls. Impulse control disorders (ICDs) were reported in both genders, with hypersexuality mostly in men. Multiple ICDs were sometimes reported in the same patient, usually reversible after DA discontinuation. In case reports, DA therapy was temporally associated with severe depression, manic episodes or psychosis, which improved after discontinuation and administration of psychiatric medications. Gender type of DA, dose and duration of therapy did not correlate with occurrence of psychiatric pathology. Conclusion Patients with hyperprolactinemia receiving DAs may develop changes in mood and behavior regardless of prior psychiatric history. Increased awareness for ICDs, depression, mania and other types of psychosis is needed by all physicians who prescribe DAs. Larger prospective controlled clinical studies are needed to delineate prevalence, risk stratification and management.",30400048,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30400048/

0,Pituitary Neoplasms,2020,Somatostatin,"Biochemical remission after transsphenoidal surgery is still unsatisfied in acromegaly patients with macroadenomas, especially with invasive macroadenomas. Concerning the impact of preoperative somatostatin analogues (SSAs) on surgical outcomes, previous studies with limited cases reported conflicting results. To assess current evidence of preoperative medical treatment, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies. A literature search was conducted in Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Five randomized controlled trials (RCT) and seven non-RCT comparative studies were included. These studies mainly focused on pituitary macroadenomas though a small number of microadenoma cases were included. For safety, preoperative SSAs were not associated with elevated risks of postoperative complications. With respect to efficacy, the short-term cure rate was improved by preoperative SSAs, but the long-term cure rate showed no significant improvement. For invasive macroadenomas, the short-term cure rate was also improved, but the long-term results were not evaluable in clinical practice because adjuvant therapy was generally required. In conclusion, preoperative SSAs are safe in patients with acromegaly, and the favorable impact on surgical results is restricted to the short-term cure rate in macroadenomas and invasive macroadenomas. Further well-designed RCTs to examine long-term results are awaited to update the finding of this meta-analysis.",31575930,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31575930/

0,Pituitary Neoplasms,2020,"Dopamine Agonists, Bromocriptine, Cabergoline","Dopamine agonists are usually very effective in the treatment of prolactinomas. Nonetheless, a subset of individuals does not respond satisfactorily to these agents, and this resistance is characterized by failure to achieve normoprolactinemia and a 30% or more reduction in maximal tumor diameter (in the case of macroprolactinoma) under maximally tolerated doses. The overall prevalence of dopamine agonist resistance is 20-30% for bromocriptine (BRC) and around 10% for cabergoline (CAB). The 2 main predictive factors are male gender and tumor invasiveness. The management of drug-resistant prolactinomas includes several options. Any BRC-resistant patient should be switched to CAB which will normalize prolactin in 80% of patients. As long as adverse effects do not develop, dose escalation of CAB is reasonable, with the expectation that subsequent dose reduction will be possible. Echocardiographic monitoring is advised in such patients because of the potential association with cardiac valvular fibrosis. Also, maintaining maximal CAB doses at 3.5 mg/week may lead to progressive hormonal control in a significant proportion of patients. Complete resistance to CAB is infrequent. In a study of 122 patients with a macroprolactinoma, only 7 (6%) could not achieve control despite maximal CAB doses for > 12 months. A large resistant prolactinoma is also an indication for transsphenoidal neurosurgery, aiming at a debulking which may improve postoperative medical control. For patients who harbor aggressive prolactinomas, radiotherapy may be considered. However, normal prolactinemia will eventually occur in only one-third of patients after many years.

0,Pituitary Neoplasms,2020,"Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating, Temozolomide","Temozolomide is an oral chemotherapy used to treat aggressive pituitary tumours since 2006. It is inexpensive and well tolerated, the main side effects are fatigue, nausea and cytopenia. Overall the studies demonstrate approximately 70% response rate for temozolomide, if response is defined radiologically as complete, partial response or stable disease. Using the more stringent criteria of complete or partial response, the success rate is near 40%. Functioning tumours respond more frequently than non-functioning tumours. Tumours which are depleted of methyl guanine methyltransferase (MGMT), as assessed by immunohistochemistry, also are more likely to respond. Temozolomide has an established role in treating pituitary tumours which have demonstrated metastases or which are refractory and progressing, despite all conventional treatment (so-called salvage treatment). The challenge is to offer temozolomide earlier in the pathway if appropriate. Tumours which demonstrate aggressive clinical behaviour (defined as clinically relevant growth despite optimal treatment) should be considered for temozolomide. One common situation when this might occur is tumour progression after surgery and radiotherapy. It is unnecessary to wait until salvage treatment is required. Anticipated (but not yet demonstrated) aggressive behaviour can be regarded as a potential indication for temozolomide, but there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend this. Ideally a trial should assess this potential indication. Early treatment could be considered in selected cases when high levels of proliferation and invasion were demonstrated, causing significant clinical concern.",31311005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31311005/

0,Pituitary Neoplasms,2020,Somatostatin,"Although effective treatment regimens (surgical resection, drug treatment with dopamine agonists or somatostatin analogues, radiotherapy) have been established for the therapy of most pituitary tumours, a considerable proportion of affected patients cannot completely cured due to incomplete resection or drug resistance. Moreover, even if hormone levels have been normalized, patients with hormone-secreting tumours still show persistent pathophysiological alterations in metabolic, cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric parameters and have an impaired quality of life. In this review reasons for the discrepancy between biochemical cure and incomplete recovery from tumour-associated comorbidities are discussed and the clinical management is delineated exemplarily for patients with acromegaly and Cushing's disease. In view of the development of additional treatment concepts for the treatment of pituitary adenomas we speculate about the relevance of RSUME as a potential target for the development of an anti-angiogenic therapy. Moreover, the role of BMP-4 which stimulates prolactinoma development through the Smad signalling cascade is described and its role as putative drug target for the treatment of prolactinomas is discussed. Regarding the well-known resistance of a part of somatotropinomas to somatostatin analogue treatment, recently identified mechanisms responsible for the drug resistance are summarized and ways to overcome them in future treatment concepts are presented. Concerning novel therapeutic options for patients with Cushing's disease the impact of retinoic acid, which is currently tested in clinical studies, is shown, and the action and putative therapeutic impact of silibinin to resolve glucocorticoid resistance in these patients is critically discussed.",31705792,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31705792/

0,Pituitary Neoplasms,2020,"Dopamine Agonists, Cabergoline","Dopamine agonists (DAs) are well recognized as the first-line therapy for prolactinomas due to their efficacy in achieving tumoral shrinkage and normoprolactinemia. However, it remains to be established the best timing to withdraw DAs and in which patients this should be attempted. Studies in the 1980s, mainly using bromocriptine, started to defy the concept that DAs should be regarded as a lifelong therapy considering that sustained normoprolactinemia was attained in a small subset of patients after drug withdrawal. The introduction of the more effective agent cabergoline led to an increase in the percentages of remission. The most recent meta-analysis on the topic stated than remission rates after withdrawal can range from 15% in macroprolactinoma patients treated with bromocriptine to 41% in those with microprolactinomas previously treated with cabergoline. When more stringent criteria were applied before attempting withdrawal, sustained remission ensued in more than 50% of the individuals. Treatment duration for more than 24 months, the achievement of normoprolactinemia, marked reduction (≥ 50%) in tumoral size and DAs tapering till a low maintenance dose (e.g. cabergoline 0.5 mg/week) have been the most consistently identified predictors of success. In addition, a growing amount of evidence suggests that the post-pregnancy/breastfeeding period and menopause are reasonable timings to re-access the need for continuing DAs therapy. Considering that the achievement of sustained normoprolactinemia is still far from being universal after the withdrawal, even in highly selected cohorts, future larger prospective studies should continue to address this issue.",31556013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31556013/

The gold-standard treatment is dopamine agonist (DA) which can reverse hyperprolactinemia and hypogonadism, and promote tumor shrinkage in the majority of cases. Therefore, reports of pregnancy in such cohort become more common. In this scenario, bromocriptine is still the DA of choice due to its shorter half-life and larger experience as compared to cabergoline. In DA resistant cases, transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is indicated. However, potential risks of DA-induced pregnancies include fetal exposition and symptomatic tumor growth. Dopamine agonist should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is confirmed in microprolactinomas and intrasellar macroprolactinomas (MAC). Concerning expansive/invasive MAC, DA maintenance should be considered. Periodically clinical evaluation should be performed during pregnancy, being sellar imaging indicated if tumor symptomatic growth is suspected.

Surgery remains the first-line treatment for most tumors overall. The role of dopaminergic agonists (DAs) and somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs) in the treatment of pituitary adenomas is quite well established for prolactinomas and growth hormone (GH) excess. However, over the last decade new multi-receptor binding SRLs are increasingly used for treatment of acromegaly and Cushing's disease. SRLs/DA chimeric compounds seem to have enhanced potency and efficacy when compared to that of individual SRLs or DA receptor agonists according to preclinical data. However, following negative results, more research is needed to determine if this interesting mechanism will translate into positive clinical effects for acromegaly patients. Furthermore, new agents that block adrenal steroidogenesis have been developed in phase III clinical trials for Cushing's disease and several new compounds working at the pituitary level and/or blocking the glucocorticoid receptor are also in development. Combination therapy of drugs with similar or different mechanisms (possibly synergistic) are also on the increase. A growing awareness regarding all mechanisms involved in both control of pituitary secretion and cellular proliferation might allow for sole medical treatment of pituitary adenomas, especially macroadenomas, rather than surgery and/or radiation therapy, in the future.

This is particularly true for aggressive prolactinomas in which surgery and radiotherapy may not achieve tumor control.

The limited reports on somatostatin analogues have shown conflicting results, but cases with optimal outcomes have been documented. Data on estrogen modulators and metformin are scarce and their usefulness remains to be evaluated. In many aggressive lactotroph tumors, temozolomide has demonstrated optimal outcomes, whereas for other cytotoxic agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and for inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), higher quality evidence is needed.

In this study, we summarize the major findings regarding the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of DA-resistant prolactinoma (DARP). Currently available evidence suggests that miRNAs are usually dysregulated in DARP and that, although controversial, the dysregulated miRNAs target the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, dopamine 2 receptor (D2R), or estradiol (E2)/estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathways to mediate the therapeutic effect of DAs. These findings provide new incentives for research on innovative strategies for predicting patients' responsiveness to dopamine therapies and for developing treatment approaches. Unfortunately, recent studies tended to focus exclusively on the differential miRNA expression profiles between DARP and dopamine-sensitive prolactinoma, and no definitive consensus has been reached regarding the role of these miRNAs in the modulation mechanism.
