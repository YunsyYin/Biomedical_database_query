Surgery is first line treatment in gastrinomas, however often fails to be curative. This manuscript reviews current strategies of medical treatment of surgically non-curable gastrinoma. Symptomatic treatment with H(+)-K(+)-ATPase proton-pump inhibitors suppresses hypersecretion of gastric acid and substantially improves quality of life in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Further medical therapy is only recommended in cases of progressive metastatic gastrinoma. In well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (G1 and G2) a so-called biotherapy with somatostatin analogues exists as first-line and chemotherapy with streptocotozin plus doxorubicine/5-FU as second-line medical treatment option. In poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (G3) chemotherapy with etoposide plus cisplatin is possible. Prospective future therapeutic strategies may include treatment with novel somatostatin analogues as well as angiogenesis inhibitors and kinase inhibitors targeting tumor-specific signaling cascades.",17985097,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17985097/

CT scan and gastroduodenoscopy showed severe stenosis of the duodenal 3rd portion. There was no evidence of malignancy. We diagnosed a stricture due to a duodenal ulcer and laparotomy was performed. By means of biopsy of No.14d lymph node in the operation, adenocarcinoma of the duodenum was pointed out and we performed a pancreatoduodenectomy. Although adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1/paclitaxel (S-1 80 mg/body, po, day 1-14 and paclitaxel 120 mg/body iv day 1, 8)was administered after operation, the patient's serum CEA was elevated and metastic lymph nodes around the supra mesenteric artery were pointed out. The patient was started on combined chemotherapy with S-1/CPT-11(S-1 80 mg/body, po, day 1-14 and CPT-11 120 mg/body iv day 1), serum CEA levels returned to normal range, and marked reduction of lymph node size was observed on CT. The patient is still alive and free of disease three years after the operation. S-1/CPT-11 could therefore be a treatment option for patients with duodenal carcinoma.",21499002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21499002/
0,Duodenal Neoplasms,2013,"Antineoplastic Agents, Taxoids, Docetaxel","A 75-year-old man who complained of upper abdominal discomfort was diagnosed with primary duodenal cancer. The patient was treated with a pancreaticoduodenectomy, ascending colectomy and postoperative chemotherapy of S-1 and irinotecan[IRIS; S-1, 80mg/m2(days 1-14); irinotecan, 100 mg/m2(days 1 and 15, every 4 weeks)]. However, after 4 IRIS cycles, computed tomography revealed a liver metastasis and massive ascites. The patient received second-line chemotherapy of tri-weekly docetaxel[60mg/m2,(day 1, every 3 weeks)]. After 2 cycles of docetaxel therapy, the liver tumor and ascites became undetectable. The patient was doing well 13 months after the operation. ",24231711,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24231711/
0,Duodenal Neoplasms,2015,"Silicates, titanium silicide, Titanium","A 63-year old man was referred to our hospital because of fever, appetite loss, and increased biliary enzyme levels. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a tumor in the duodenal papilla, diagnosed as an adenocarcinoma via biopsy, and computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple tumors in the liver. Chemotherapy with TS-1 was initiated based on a diagnosis of ampullary cancer with multiple liver metastases. After TS-1 treatment, the multiple tumors were no longer detectable, and the primary tumor did not increase in size for 4 years. At this time, however, the patient experienced fever, jaundice, and appetite loss. The hepatic mass was not detected via CT or MRI. The primary tumor was determined to be resectable; therefore, we performed subtotal stomach preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. The patient was discharged 55 days after surgery and is alive without recurrence 2 years after surgery.",25812510,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25812510/
0,Duodenal Neoplasms,2015,"Silicates, titanium silicide, Titanium","An 89-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for thorough investigation of refractory diabetes mellitus, which revealed primary squamous cell carcinoma of the duodenum. After two courses of chemotherapy, follow-up esophagoduodenogastroscopy and duodenal biopsy showed no evidence of tumor. No findings were suggestive of recurrence of the primary lesion 19 months after starting chemotherapy. This case suggests that chemotherapy including TS-1 may be effective for treating unresectable primary squamous cell carcinoma of the duodenum.",25482907,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25482907/
